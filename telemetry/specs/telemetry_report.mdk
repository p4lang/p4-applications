# Introduction

Traditional network monitoring has relied on statistics and probe packets
such as ICMP echo requests/replies. Recent innovations provide greater
insight into network behavior by generating detailed reports of telemetry
metadata such as paths, queue occupancy, latency experienced by data
packets, and timestamps that can be used to determine hop-by-hop and
end-to-end delay. Generation of telemetry reports can be triggered by
various events in categories such as flow monitoring, queue congestion, and
packet drops. For further information regarding the motivation and usage of
detailed telemetry information can be found in the IETF draft for
In-situ OAM [^IOAM_reqs].

Specifications are being defined for embedding telemetry metadata within
data packets, such as INT [^INT] and IOAM [^IOAM]. This allows for telemetry
metadata to be collected as packets traverse a network. When the packets
reach the edge of the network, the telemetry metadata is removed and
telemetry reports are generated.

This specification defines packet formats for telemetry reports from data
plane network devices (e.g. switches) to a distributed telemetry monitoring
system. The packet formats use headers that describe the contents of
telemetry reports, along with existing (non-telemetry specific) packet
headers that can be used to categorize flows.

## Scope

The scope of this specification is interoperability between network devices
that generate telemetry reports based on what they see in the data plane,
and the initial preprocessors within distributed telemetry monitoring
systems that receive the telemetry reports. This specification is
applicable when telemetry reports are generated by network devices at the
edges of a network, with source and transit network devices embedding
telemetry metadata in data packets according to specifications such as INT
[^INT] and IOAM [^IOAM]. This specification is also applicable when each network
device directly generates telemetry reports (including transit network
devices in the middle of the network), without affecting data packet
formats between successive network devices.

Telemetry report encapsulation formats are defined that allow for the
inclusion of additional telemetry metadata, beyond the (optional) telemetry
metadata embedded between other packet headers as defined in INT and
IOAM. The embedded telemetry metadata is included as is in telemetry
reports, so the packet formats defined in INT and IOAM also define
some aspects of the telemetry report format. See Section [#embedded] for
further discussion.

This specification does not address any of the following, which are
considered out of scope:

* Configuration of network devices so that they can determine when to
generate telemetry reports, and what information to include in those
reports, such as SAI DTel [^SAI_DTel].
* Events that trigger generation of telemetry reports.
* Selection of particular destinations within distributed telemetry
monitoring systems, to which telemetry reports will be sent.
* Export format for flow statistics or summarized flow records such as
IPFIX [^IPFIX].

# Key Concepts

## Telemetry Report Definition

We define a telemetry report as a message that a network device sends to
the monitoring system. A telemetry report carries a snapshot of the
original data packet (mostly the inner + outer headers), which triggered
the reporting, together with additional telemetry metadata collected from
the reporting network device, and possibly from its upstream network
devices (in case of in-band mechanism like INT or IOAM). The report
message is encapsulated by IP+UDP, hence it can be forwarded from the
reporting network device through the data network, and to the destination
monitoring system.

The following sections will cover the details on the report generation,
report format and encapsulation.

## Telemetry Report Associations

There are many reasons why users may want telemetry reports to be
generated. This specification currently considers three categories for
telemetry report generation:

* Tracked Flows
  : Telemetry reports are generated matching certain flow definitions. A
    telemetry specific access control list (called a flow watchlist in this
    specification) determines which data packets to monitor by matching
    packet header fields and optionally identification of the ingress
    interface. (Note that the telemetry specific watchlist is not
    performing any access control. It only makes decisions related to
    monitoring actions.) The expectation is that telemetry reports can be
    generated for those packets that match the flow watchlist. The
    telemetry reports include information about the path that packets
    traverse as well as other telemetry metadata such as hop latency and
    queue occupancy.

* Dropped Packets
  : Telemetry reports are generated for all dropped packets matching a
    telemetry specific access control list (called a drop watchlist in this
    specification). This provides visibility into the impact of packet
    drops on user traffic.

[]{tex-cmd: "\newpage"}

* Congested Queues
  : Telemetry reports are generated for traffic entering a specific queue
    during a period of queue congestion. This provides visibility into the
    traffic causing and prolonging queue congestion, for example a few
    large elephant flows that overwhelm a queue, as well as the victim
    traffic (mice flows) getting hurt by the congestion. This also enables
    the detection and “re-play” of a short microburst, caused by a large
    number of mice flows arriving at the queue at the same time.

Each telemetry report may be associated with one or more of these
categories. This is indicated in the telemetry report by defining
association bits, one for each category, as will be shown in Section
[#report-format]. New categories (and corresponding association bits) may
be added to future versions of this specification.

Network devices will need to be configured so that they can determine when
to generate telemetry reports, and what information to include in those
reports. Such configuration is considered to be beyond the scope of this
specification. See [^SAI_DTel] for one API proposal to enable data plane
telemetry capabilities in network devices across all three categories.

## Telemetry Report Events

Telemetry reports are typically triggered by packet processing at a network
device. However, even when processed packets match a watchlist for a
telemetry report category, it is not necessary for each inspected packet to
trigger generation of a telemetry report. Network devices may apply filters
to determine when significant events occur that should be reported. This is
called event detection in this specification. For example, a network device
may trigger telemetry report generation whenever a packet matching a
tracked application flow is received or transmitted on a different path
than previous packets, or if a significant change in latency is experienced
at one particular hop.

Determination of which packets trigger reports, in other words the specific
conditions and logic to determine the events of interest, is left open for
implementations to differentiate themselves, and is considered to be beyond
the scope of this specification.

## Telemetry Reporting Modes

There are different modes which differ with regard to the locations
from which telemetry reports are generated.

### Individual Reports in INT-XD/MX modes

In the INT-XD (eXport Data) mode, as defined in the INT spec, each individual 
network device generates its own telemetry reports (Figure [#fig-individual-report-arch]). 
The distributed telemetry monitoring system will receive reports from different network 
devices, each describing the telemetry metadata (such as switch IDs, port IDs, latency)
for one hop. Within the individual telemetry reports, the telemetry metadata
precedes the details of the original packet header. There is no change to data packets 
traversing the network.
This mode was known as "Postcard" mode in the previous versions of this
Telemetry Report spec.

   generated by individual switches in INT-XD modes." }
![INT-XD-arch]

[INT-XD-arch]: images/telemetry_arch_individual.jpg { width: 6.0in }

In the INT-MX (eMbed instruct(X)ions) mode, as defined in the INT spec,
the source node embeds instructions in the INT-MX header. Upon receipt of a packet 
with this INT type, each network device in the flow path generates its own telemetry 
reports, as shown in Figure [#fig-INT-MX-arch]. The distributed telemetry monitoring 
system will receive reports from different network devices, each describing the telemetry 
metadata (such as switch IDs, port IDs, latency) for one hop. There is no change to data 
packets, besides the source node embedding the INT-MX Header with instructions. The sink 
node removes the INT-MX Header from such packets. When using INT-MX mode, the telemetry 
metadata precedes the details of the original packet headers within the telemetry report.

   generated by all switches." }

~
[INT-MX-arch]: images/telemetry_arch_postcard.jpg { width: 6.0in }

### Aggregated Reports in INT-MD mode

In the INT-MD (eMbed Data) mode, telemetry metadata is embedded in between the
original headers of data packets as they traverse the network, as shown in
Figure [#fig-int-arch]. This may be done using any of the telemetry data
plane specifications such as INT or IOAM. When a packet enters the
network, the source switch may insert a telemetry instruction header,
thereby instructing downstream switches to add the desired telemetry
metadata. At each hop, the transit switch inserts its telemetry metadata.
The sink switch extracts the telemetry instruction header before
progressing the original packet. Depending on the result of event
detection, the sink switch may generate a telemetry report containing all
of the aggregated telemetry metadata from all hops across the network.

~ Figure { #fig-INT-MD-arch; caption: "Telemetry Architecture with aggregated \
  reports generated by sink switches in INT-MD mode." }
![INT-MD-arch]
~
[INT-MD-arch]: images/telemetry_arch_figure.jpg { width: 7.5in }

In order to reduce complexity at the sink switch, some telemetry reports
may include embedded telemetry metadata intermingled with the details of
original packet headers. This simplifies generation of telemetry reports 
due to receipt of data packets with embedded telemetry metadata. The 
telemetry data plane specification such as INT or IOAM specifies the format 
for this portion of the telemetry metadata. This approach reduces data plane
complexity, allowing for all telemetry report processing and generation to
be done in the data plane itself without any need to punt to the control
plane for further processing.

The sink switch has the option to add its local telemetry metadata either
in the telemetry report header defined in this specification, or in the
embedded telemetry metadata intermingled with the original packet headers.

### Using Different Telemetry Modes for Different Telemetry Categories

Even when aggregated reports are generated for the category of
tracked flows using INT-MD mode, it is possible to generate individual
reports for other
categories such as dropped packets and congested queues. The latter
categories are often monitored as per switch, per port, or per queue local
events, suggesting that telemetry reports should be generated directly from
the affected switch(es).

## Correlation of Telemetry Reports

Telemetry reports for a specific application flow matching a flow watchlist
may be received from multiple network devices. In case of INT-XD and INT-MX
modes,
each hop will generate a separate individual report. Even when telemetry
metadata is embedded in the data plane according to a specification such as
INT or IOAM , telemetry reports for one flow may still be generated by
multiple network devices in case of path change or in case of dropped
packets.

The distributed telemetry monitoring system may want to correlate these
telemetry reports, based on the original packet header fields included in
each telemetry report. The telemetry reports include one association bit
for each telemetry report category, providing hints to the distributed
telemetry monitoring system that it can use to assist with telemetry report
correlation. In particular, the distributed telemetry monitoring system may
want to apply certain types of telemetry report correlation only when the
corresponding bits are set.

The mechanisms for correlation are left to each implementation, and are
considered to be beyond the scope of this specification.

# Telemetry Report Formats { #report-format }

This section specifies the packet formats for telemetry reports.

## Outer Encapsulation

Telemetry reports are defined using a UDP-based encapsulation. Various
outer encapsulations may be used to transport the UDP packets. Typically
this would simply be an Ethernet header, followed by an IPv4 or IPv6
header, followed by the UDP header. This specification does not preclude
the use of different transport encapsulations.

The source IP address identifies the network device that generates the
telemetry report.

The Destination IP address identifies a location in the distributed
telemetry monitoring system that will receive the telemetry report.

In case of IPv4, as is the case for any other IP packet, either the Don’t
Fragment (DF) bit must be set, or the IPv4 ID field must be set so that the
value does not repeat within the maximum datagram lifetime for a given
source address/destination address/protocol tuple.

### UDP header (8 octets)

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

The Source Port may optionally be used to carry flow entropy, for example
based on a hash of the inner 5-tuple. Otherwise, it should be set to 0.

The Destination Port is user configurable. The expectation is that the same
Destination Port value will be used for all telemetry reports in a
particular deployment.

## Flow Identification

There is no explicit metadata defined for flow identification. The expectation is that either:

  - a truncated packet fragment including packet headers will be included in the telemetry report, 
  allowing the distributed telemetry monitoring system to categorize and identify flows in any 
  manner that it desires, or

  - domain specific flow identification metadata will be included.

## Embedded Telemetry Metadata { #embedded }

There may still be further telemetry metadata embedded within the payload
after the Telemetry Report header. For example, this is typically the case
when there is telemetry metadata from hops prior to the network device
generating the report. The telemetry metadata will typically be encoded
using a defined data plane format such as INT and IOAM.

A network device generating a telemetry report may include its local
telemetry metadata in any of the following:

* the embedded telemetry metadata,

* the Telemetry Report header in the same telemetry report as the embedded
telemetry metadata from previous hops, or
* the Telemetry Report header in a separate telemetry report from the
embedded telemetry metadata from previous hops. Note that in this case the
ingress timestamp will be the same in the Telemetry Report Header in both
telemetry reports.

If the Tracked Flow Association bit is set to 0, then there will not be any
embedded telemetry metadata in the report.

If the Tracked Flow Association bit is set to 1, there may or may not be
any embedded telemetry metadata in the report. See Section [#parsing] for
parsing considerations.

## Parsing Considerations { #parsing }

When a telemetry report is received by the distributed telemetry monitoring
system, it must parse the packet to retrieve the telemetry metadata and to
identify the flow. Figure [#fig-outer-encap] shows which headers will be
present at the beginning of the packet, assuming a simple Ethernet/IP
transport of the telemetry report packet.

The packet format after this point can vary depending on the format of the
original packet, and whether embedded telemetry metadata is present. The
following figures show a few examples of the remaining packet format. These
examples are not intended to be complete or exclusive.

Figure [#fig-flat-packet] shows the remaining packet format when the
original packet is a simple flat packet and there is no embedded telemetry
metadata.

Figure [#fig-int-over-l4] shows the remaining packet format when the
original packet is a simple flat packet and there is embedded INT over
TCP/UDP telemetry metadata.

           Flat Packet with INT over TCP/UDP" }

![ioam-vxlan]
~
[ioam-vxlan]: images/telemetry_report_ioam_vxlan.jpg { width: 3.5in }

Even when using INT over TCP/UDP, the original packet may be an
encapsulated packet such as a VXLAN packet. When processing a telemetry
report for an encapsulated packet, the distributed telemetry monitoring
system may desire to categorize flows based on inner headers. In this case,
it should parse the telemetry report all the way down past any embedded
telemetry metadata (if present), even when the Telemetry Report Header
includes optional metadata such as drop reason. It may also want to process
the embedded telemetry metadata, for example to recognize the case where a
path change directs traffic to a congested switch where packets are being
dropped.

Figure [#fig-int-over-l4-vxlan] shows the remaining packet format when the
original packet is a VXLAN packet and there is embedded INT over
TCP/UDP telemetry metadata.

Figure [#fig-ioam-vxlan] shows the remaining packet format when the
original packet is a VXLAN packet and there is embedded IOAM Trace
telemetry metadata. See IOAM drafts [^IOAM][^IOAM_VXLAN_GPE] for further details.
