# Introduction

Inband Network Telemetry (“INT”) is a framework designed to allow the
collection and reporting of network state, by the data plane, without requiring
intervention or work by the control plane in collecting and delivering
the state from the data plane. In the INT architectural model,
packets may contain header fields that are interpreted as “telemetry
instructions” by network devices.
INT traffic sources (applications, end-host networking stacks,
hypervisors, NICs, send-side ToRs, etc.) can embed the instructions either in
normal data packets, cloned copies of the data packets or in special probe packets.
Alternatively, the instructions may be
programmed in the network data plane to match on particular network flows
and to execute the instructions on the matched flows.

These instructions tell an INT-capable device what state to collect.
The network state information may be directly exported by the data plane
to the telemetry monitoring system, or can be
written into the packet as it traverses the
network. When the information is embedded in the packets, INT traffic sinks
retrieve (and optionally report) the collected results of these instructions,
allowing the traffic sinks to monitor the exact data plane state that the
packets “observed” while being forwarded.

Some examples of traffic sink behavior are described below:

* OAM – the traffic sink[^Transit] might simply collect the encoded network state, then
export that state to an external controller.  This export could be in a raw
format, or could be combined with basic processing (such as compression,
deduplication, truncation).

* Real-time control or feedback loops – traffic sinks might use the encoded
data plane information  to feed back control information to traffic sources,
which could in turn use this information to make changes to traffic engineering
or packet forwarding.  (Explicit congestion notification schemes are an example
of these types of feedback loops).

* Network Event Detection - If the collected path state indicates a condition
that requires immediate attention or resolution (such as severe congestion or
violation of certain data-plane invariances), the traffic sinks[^Transit] could generate
immediate actions to respond to the network events, forming a feedback control
loop either in a centralized or a fully decentralized fashion (a la TCP).

[]{tex-cmd: "\newpage"}

The INT architectural model is intended to be generic and enables a
number of interesting high level applications, such as:

* Network troubleshooting and performance monitoring
  - Traceroute, micro-burst detection, packet history (a.k.a. postcards[^Postcard])
* Advanced congestion control
* Advanced routing
  - Utilization-aware routing (For example, HULA[^HULA], CLOVE[^CLOVE])
* Network data plane verification

A number of use case descriptions and evaluations are described in the Millions
of Little Minions paper [^Minions].

# Terminology

* **Monitoring System**:
  : A system that collects telemetry data sent from different network devices.
    The monitoring system components may be physically distributed but logically
    centralized.

* **INT Header**:
  : A packet header that carries INT information. There are three types of INT
    Headers -- *eMbed data (MD-type)*, *eMbed instruction (MX-type)* and
    *Destination-type* (See Section [#sec-int-header-types]).

* **INT Packet**:
  : A packet containing an INT Header.

* **INT Node**:
  : An INT-capable network device that participates in the INT data plane by
    regularly carrying out at least one of the following: inserting, adding to,
    removing, or processing instructions from INT Headers in INT packets.
    Depending on deployment scenarios, examples of INT Nodes may include devices
    such as routers, switches, and NICs.

* **INT Instruction**:
  : Instructions indicating which INT Metadata (defined below) to collect at
    each INT node. The instructions are either configured at each INT-capable
    node's Flow Watchlist or written into the INT Header.

* **Flow Watchlist**:
  : A dataplane table that matches on packet headers and inserts or applies
    INT instructions on each matched flow. A flow is a set of packets having the
    same values on the selected header fields.

* **INT Source**:
  : A trusted entity that creates and inserts INT Headers into the packets it
    sends. A Flow Watchlist is configured to select the flows in which INT
    headers are to be inserted.

* **INT Sink**:
  : A trusted entity that extracts the INT Headers and collects the path state
    contained in the INT Headers. The INT Sink is responsible for removing INT
    Headers so as to make INT transparent to upper layers. (Note that this does
    not preclude having nested or hierarchical INT domains.) The INT Sink can
    decide to send the collected information to the monitoring system.

* **INT Transit Hop**:
  : A trusted entity that collects metadata from the data plane by following
    the INT Instructions. Based on the instructions, the data may be directly
    exported to the telemetry monitoring system or embedded into the INT Header
    of the packet.

Note that one physical device
may play multiple roles -- INT Source, Transit, Sink -- at the same time
for the same or different flows. For example, an INT Source node may
embed its own metadata into the packet, playing the roles of INT Transit as well.

* **INT Metadata**:
  : Information that an INT Source or an INT Transit Hop node inserts into the
    INT Header, or into a telemetry report. Examples of metadata are described
    in Section [#what-to-monitor].

* **INT Domain**:
  : A set of inter-connected INT nodes under the same administration. This
    specification defines the behavior and packet header formats for
    interoperability between INT nodes from different vendors in an INT
    domain. The INT nodes within the same domain must be configured in a
    consistent way to ensure interoperability between the nodes. Operators of
    an INT domain should deploy INT Sink capability at domain edges to prevent
    INT information from leaking out of the domain.

# INT Modes of Operation
Since INT was first introduced at P4.org in 2015, a number of variations of INT
have been evolved and discussed in IETF and industry communities.
Also the term 'INT' has been used to broadly indicate data plane telemetry in
general, not limited to the original classic INT where both instructions and
metadata are embedded in the data packets. Hence we define different modes of
INT operation based on the degree of packet modifications, i.e., what to
embed in the packets.

The different modes of operation are described in detail below, and summarized
in Figure [#fig-int-modes].

## INT Application Modes

Original data packets are monitored and may be modified
to carry INT instructions and metadata.
There are three variations based on the level of packet modifications.

* **INT-XD** (eXport Data): INT nodes directly export metadata from their
  dataplane to the monitoring system based on the INT instructions configured
  at their Flow Watchlists. No packet Modification is needed.

  This mode was also known as "Postcard" mode in the previous versions of
  the Telemetry Report spec, originally inspired by [^Postcard].

* **INT-MX** (eMbed instruct(X)ions): The INT Source node embeds INT
  instructions in the packet header, then the INT Source, each INT Transit, and
  the INT sink directly send the metadata to the monitoring system by following
  the instructions embedded in the packets. The INT Sink node strips the
  instruction header before forwarding the packet to the receiver. Packet
  modification is limited to the instruction header, the packet size doesn't
  grow as the packet traverses more Transit nodes.

  INT-MX also supports 'source-inserted' metadata as part of Domain Specific
  Instructions. This allows the INT Source to embed additional metadata that
  other nodes or the monitoring system can consume.

  This mode is inspired by IOAM's "Direct Export" [^IOAM] [^IOAM-DEX].

* **INT-MD** (eMbed Data): In this mode both INT instructions and metadata are
  written into the packets. This is the classic hop-by-hop INT where 1) INT
  Source embeds instructions, 2) INT Source & Transit embed metadata, and 3) INT
  Sink strips the instructions and aggregated metadata out of the packet and
  (selectively) sends the data to the monitoring system.
  The packet is modified the most in this mode while it minimizes the overhead
  at the monitoring system to collate reports from multiple INT nodes.

  Since v2.0, INT-MD mode supports 'source-only' metadata as part of Domain
  Specific Instructions. This allows the INT Source to embed additional
  metadata for the INT Sink or the monitoring system to consume.

**NOTE: the rest of the spec is assuming INT-MD as the default mode, unless
specified otherwise.**

## INT Applied to Synthetic Traffic

INT Source nodes may generate INT-marked synthetic traffic either by
cloning original data packets or by generating special probe packets.
INT is applied to this traffic by transit nodes in exactly the same way
as all traffic.

The only difference between live traffic and Synthetic traffic is that
INT Sink nodes may need to discard synthetic traffic after extracting
the collected INT data as opposed to forwarding the traffic. This is
indicated by using the 'D' bit of the INT Header to mark relevant packets
as being copies/clones or probes, to be 'D'iscarded at the INT Sink.

All INT modes may be used on these synthetic/probe packets, as decided by the INT Source node.
Specifically the **INT-MD** (eMbed Data) mode applied to Synthetic or probe packets allows
functionality similar to **IFA**[^IFA].

It is likely that synthetic traffic created by cloning would be discarded at the Sink,
while Probe packets might be marked for forwarding or discarding, depending on the
use-case. It is the responsibility of the INT Source node to mark packets correctly
to determine if the INT Sink will forward or discard packets after extracting the
INT Data collected along the path.

# What To Monitor { #what-to-monitor }

In theory, one may be able to define and collect any device-internal
information using the INT approach. In practice, however, it seems useful to
define a small baseline set of metadata that can be made available on a wide
variety of devices:  the metadata listed in this section comprises such a set.
As the INT specification evolves, we expect to add more metadata to this
INT specification.

The exact meaning of the following metadata (e.g., the unit of timestamp
values, the precise definition of hop latency, queue occupancy or buffer
occupancy) can vary from one device to another for any number of reasons,
including the heterogeneity of device architecture, feature sets,
resource limits, etc. Thus, defining the exact meaning of each metadata is
beyond the scope of this document. Instead we assume that the semantics of
metadata for each device model used in a deployment is communicated with
the entities interpreting/analyzing the reported data in an out-of-band fashion.

## Device-level Information

* Node id
  : The unique ID of an INT node.
    This is generally administratively assigned. Node IDs must be unique
    within an INT domain.

## Ingress Information

* Ingress interface identifier
  : The interface on which the INT packet was received. A packet may be received
    on an arbitrary stack of interface constructs starting with a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be received on a physical port that belongs to
    a link aggregation port group, which in turn is part of a Layer 3 Switched
    Virtual Interface, and at Layer 3 the packet may be received in a tunnel.
    Although the entire interface stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of ingress interface
    identifiers. The first level of ingress interface identifier would typically
    be used to monitor the physical port on which the packet was received, hence
    a 16-bit field (half of a 4-Byte metadata) is deemed adequate. The second
    level of ingress interface identifier occupies a full 4-Byte metadata field,
    which may be used to monitor a logical interface on which the packet was
    received.  A 32-bit space at the second level allows for an adequately large
    number of logical interfaces at each network element. The semantics of
    interface identifiers may differ across devices, each INT hop chooses the
    interface type it reports at each of the two levels.

* Ingress timestamp
  : The device local time when the INT packet was received on the ingress
    physical or logical port.

## Egress Information

* Egress interface identifier
  : The interface on which the INT packet was sent out. A packet may
    be transmitted on an arbitrary stack of interface constructs ending at a
    physical port. For example, a packet may be transmitted on a tunnel,
    out of a Layer 3 Switched Virtual Interface, on a Link Aggregation Group,
    out of a particular physical port belonging to the Link Aggregation Group.
    Although the entire interface stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of egress interface
    identifiers. The first level of egress interface identifier would typically
    be used to monitor the physical port on which the packet was transmitted,
    hence a 16-bit field (half of a 4-Byte metadata) is deemed adequate.
    The second level of egress interface identifier occupies a full
    4-Byte metadata field, which may be used to monitor a logical interface on
    which the packet was transmitted. A 32-bit space at the second level
    allows for an adequately large number of logical interfaces at each network
    element. The semantics of interface identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the interface type it reports at each of the two levels.

* Egress timestamp
  : The device local time when the INT packet was processed by the egress
    physical or logical port.

* Hop latency
  : Time taken for the INT packet to be switched within the device.

* Egress interface TX Link utilization
  : Current utilization of the egress interface via which the INT packet was
    sent out. Again, devices can use different mechanisms to keep track of the
    current rate, such as bin bucketing or moving average. While the latter is
    clearly superior to the former, the INT framework does not stipulate the
    mechanics and simply leaves those decisions to device vendors.

* Queue occupancy
  ~ The build-up of traffic in the queue (in bytes, cells, or packets) that the
    INT packet observes in the device while being forwarded. The format of this
    4-octet metadata field is implementation specific and the metadata semantics
    YANG model shall describe the format and units of this metadata field in the
    metadata stack.

* Buffer occupancy
  : The build-up of traffic in the buffer (in bytes, cells, or packets) that the
    INT packet observes in the device while being forwarded. Use case is when
    the buffer is shared between multiple queues. The format of this 4-octet
    metadata field is implementation specific and the metadata semantics YANG
    model shall describe the format and units of this metadata field in the
    metadata stack.

A metadata semantics YANG model [^metadata-yang] is being developed that allows
nodes to report details of the metadata format, units, and semantics.

# INT Headers

This section specifies the format and location of INT Headers.
INT Headers and their locations are relevant for INT-MX and INT-MD modes where
the INT instructions (and metadata stack in case of MD mode) are written into
the packets.

## INT Header Types

There are three types of INT Headers: MD-type, MX-type and Destination-type.
A given INT packet may carry either of MD or MX type headers, and/or
a Destination-type header. When Destination-type and MD-type or MX-type
headers are present, the MD-type header or MX-type header must precede the
Destination-type header.

* MD-type (**INT Header type 1**)
  - Intermediate nodes (INT Transit Hops) must process this type of INT
    Header. The format of this header is defined in Section
    [#sec-int-md-metadata-header-format].
* Destination-type (**INT Header type 2**)
  - Destination headers must only be consumed by the INT Sink. Intermediate
    nodes must ignore Destination headers.
  - Destination headers can be used to enable Edge-to-Edge communication between
    the INT Source and INT Sink. For example:
      - INT Source can add a sequence number to detect loss of INT packets.
      - INT Source can add the original values of IP TTL and INT Remaining
        Hop Count, thus enabling the INT sink to detect network devices
        on the path that do not support INT by comparing the IP TTL
        decrement against INT Remaining Hop Count decrement (assuming each
        network device is an L3 hop)
  - The format of Destination-type headers will be defined in a future
    revision. Note some Edge-to-Edge INT use cases can be supported by
    'source-only' and 'source-inserted' metadata, part of Domain Specific
    Instructions in the MD-type and MX-type headers.
* MX-type (**INT Header type 3**)
  - Intermediate nodes (INT Transit Hops) must process this type of INT
    Header and generate reports to the monitoring system as instructed.
    The format of this header is defined in Section [#int-mx-header].

## Per-Hop Header Operations

### INT Source Node

In the INT-MD and INT-MX modes, the INT Source node in the packet forwarding
path creates the INT-MD or INT-MX Header.

In INT-MD, the source node add its own INT metadata after the header. To avoid
exhausting header space in the case of a forwarding loop or any other anomalies,
it is strongly recommended to limit the number of total INT metadata fields added
by Transit Hop nodes by setting the *Remaining Hop Count* field in INT header
appropriately.

The INT-MD and INT-MX headers are described in detail in the subsequent
sections.

### INT Transit Hop Node

In the INT-MD mode, each node in the packet forwarding path creates additional
space in the INT-MD Header on-demand to add its own INT metadata. To avoid
exhausting header space in the case of a forwarding loop or any other anomalies,
each INT Transit Hop must decrement the *Remaining Hop Count* field in the INT
header appropriately.

In the INT-MX mode, each node in the packet forwarding path follows the
intructions in the INT-MX Header, gathers the device specific metadata and
exports the device metadata using the Telemetry Report.

INT Transit Hop nodes may update the *DS Flags* field in the INT-MD or INT-MX
header. The *Hop ML*, *Instruction Bitmap*, *Domain Specific ID* and
*DS Instruction* fields must not be modified by Transit Hop nodes.

### INT Sink Node

In INT-MD mode, the INT Sink node removes the INT Headers and Metadata stack from
the packet, and decides whether to report the collected information.

In INT-MX mode, the INT Sink node removes the INT-MX header, gathers the
device specific metadata and decides whether to report that metadata.

## MTU Settings

In both INT-MX and INT-MD modes, it is possible that insertion of the INT header
at the INT Source node may cause the egress link MTU to be exceeded.

In INT-MD mode, as each hop creates additional space in the INT header
to add its metadata, the packet size increases. This can potentially
cause egress link MTU to be exceeded at an INT node.

This may be addressed in the following ways -

* It is recommended that the MTU of links between INT sources and sinks be
configured to a value higher than the MTU of preceding links (server/VM NIC
MTUs) by an appropriate amount. Configuring an MTU differential of
[Per-hop Metadata Length\*4\*INT Hop Count + Fixed INT Header Length] bytes
(just [Fixed INT Header Length] for INT-MX mode),
based on conservative values of total number of INT hops and Per-hop
Metadata Length, will prevent egress MTU being exceeded due to INT metadata
insertion at INT hops. The Fixed INT Header Length is the sum of INT metadata
header length (12B) and the size of encapsulation-specific shim/option header
(4B) as defined in Section [#sec-header-location].

* An INT source/transit node may optionally participate in dynamic discovery
of Path MTU for flows being monitored by INT by transmitting ICMP message to
the traffic source as per Path MTU Discovery mechanisms of the corresponding
L3 protocol (RFC 1191 for IPv4, RFC 1981 for IPv6). An INT source or transit
node may report a conservative MTU in the ICMP message, assuming that the
packet will go through the maximum number of allowed INT hops (i.e. *Remaining
Hop Count* will decrement to zero), accounting for cumulative metadata
insertion at all INT hops, and assuming that the egress MTU at all downstream
INT hops is the same as its own egress link MTU. This will help the path
MTU discovery source to converge to a path MTU estimate
faster, although this would be a conservative path MTU estimate.
Alternatively, each INT hop may report an MTU only accounting for the metadata
it inserts. This would enable the path MTU discovery source converge to a
precise path MTU, at the cost of receiving more ICMP messages, one from each
INT hop.

Regardless of whether or not an INT transit node participates in Path MTU
discovery, if it cannot insert all requested metadata because doing so will
cause the packet length to exceed egress link MTU, it must either:

  - not insert any metadata and set the M bit in the INT header, indicating
    that egress MTU was exceeded at an INT hop, or

  - report the metadata stack collected from previous hops (setting the
    Intermediate Report bit if a Telemetry Report 2.0 [^telem-report] packet is
    generated) and remove the reported metadata stack from the packet, including
    the metadata from this transit hop in either the report or embedding in the
    INT-MD metadata header.

An INT source inserts 12 bytes of fixed INT headers, and may also insert
Per-hop Metadata Length\*4 bytes of its own metadata. If inserting the
fixed headers causes egress link MTU to be exceeded, INT cannot not be
initiated for such packets. If an INT source is programmed to insert
its own INT metadata, and there is enough room in a packet to insert fixed INT
headers, but no additional room for its INT metadata, the source must
initiate INT and set the M bit in the INT header.

In theory, an INT transit node can perform IPv4 fragmentation to overcome
egress MTU limitation when inserting its metadata. However, IPv4 fragmentation
can have adverse impact on applications. Moreover, IPv6 packets cannot be
fragmented at intermediate hops. Also, fragmenting packets at INT transit hops,
with or without copying preceding INT metadata into fragments imposes
extra complexity of correlating fragments in the INT monitoring engine.
Considering all these factors, this specification requires that an INT
node must not fragment packets in order to append INT information to
the packet.

## Congestion Considerations

Use of the INT encapsulation should not increase the impact of congestion on
the network. While many transport protocols (e.g. TCP, SCTP, DCCP, QUIC)
inherently provide congestion control mechanisms, other transport protocols
(e.g. UDP) do not. For the latter case, applications may provide congestion
control or limit the traffic volume.

It is recommended not to apply INT to application traffic that is known not to
be congestion controlled (as described in RFC 8085 [^RFC8085] Section 3.1.11).
In order to achieve this, packet filtering mechanisms such as access control
lists should be provided, with match criteria including IP protocol and L4
ports.

Because INT encapsulation endpoints are located within the same administrative
domain, an operator may allow for INT encapsulation of traffic that is known
not to be congestion controlled. In this case, the operator should carefully
consider the potential impact of congestion, and implement appropriate
mechanisms for controlling or mitigating the effects of congestion. This
includes capacity planning, traffic engineering, rate limiting, and other
mechanisms.

## INT over any encapsulation

The specific location for INT Headers is intentionally not specified:
an INT Header can be inserted as an option or payload of any encapsulation
type. The only requirements are that the encapsulation header provides
sufficient space to carry the INT information and that all INT nodes
(Sources, transit hops and Sinks) agree on the location of the INT Headers.
The following choices are potential encapsulations using common protocol
stacks, although a deployment may choose a different encapsulation format
if better suited to their needs and environment.

* INT over VXLAN (as VXLAN payload, per GPE extension)
* INT over Geneve (as Geneve option)
* INT over NSH (as NSH payload)
* INT over TCP (as payload)
* INT over UDP (as payload)
* INT over GRE (as a shim between GRE header and encapsulated payload)

## Checksum Update

As described above in Section [#sec-int-over-any-encapsulation], INT
headers and metadata may be carried in an L4 protocol such as TCP or UDP,
or in an encapsulation header that includes an L4 header, such as VXLAN.
The checksum field in the TCP or UDP L4 header needs
to be updated as INT nodes modify the L4 payload via insertion/removal of
INT headers and metadata. However, there are certain exceptions.
For example, when UDP is transported over IPv4, it is possible to assign a
zero checksum, causing the receiver to ignore the value of the checksum field
(as defined in RFC 768). For UDP over IPv6, there are specific use cases in
which it is possible to assign a zero Checksum (as defined in RFC 6936).

INT source, transit and sink nodes must comply with IETF standards
for Layer 4 transport protocols with respect to whether or not Layer 4
checksum is to be updated upon modification of Layer 4 payload.
For example, if an INT source/transit/sink hop receives
UDP traffic with zero L4 checksum, it must not update the L4 checksum
in conformance with the behavior defined in relevant IETF standards
such as RFC 768 and RFC 6936.

When L4 checksum update is required, an INT source/transit node may update
the checksum in one of two ways:

* Update the L4 Checksum field such that the new value is equal to the checksum
of the new packet, after the INT-related updates (header additions/removals,
field updates), or

* If the INT source indicates that Checksum-neutral updates are allowed by
setting an instruction bit corresponding to the Checksum Complement metadata,
then the INT source/transit nodes may assign a value to the Checksum
Complement metadata which guarantees that the existing L4 Checksum is the
correct value of the packet after the INT-related updates.

The motivation for the Checksum Complement is that some hardware implementations
process data packets in a serial order, which may impose a problem when INT
fields and metadata that reside after the L4 Checksum field are inserted or
modified. Therefore, the Checksum Complement metadata, if present, is the last
metadata field in the stack.

Note that when the Checksum Complement metadata is present source/transit
nodes may choose to update the L4 Checksum field instead of using the
Checksum Complement metadata. In this case the Checksum Complement metadata
must be assigned the reserved value 0xFFFFFFFF. A host that verifies the
L4 Checksum will be unaffected by whether some or all of the nodes chose
not to use the Checksum Complement, since the value of the L4 Checksum
should fit the Checksum of the payload in either of the cases.

INT sink cannot perform a Checksum-neutral update using Checksum Complement
metadata as it removes all INT headers from the packet. Thus, an INT sink
when performing a checksum update has to do so by updating the L4 Checksum
field.

Regardless of whether checksum update is performed via modifying the L4
checksum field or via use of Checksum Complement metadata, performing the
update based on an incremental checksum calculation (as is typically done)
will ensure that any potential corruption is detected at the point of
checksum validation. If full checksum computation is performed at an INT
node, it should be preceded by checksum validation so as to not mask out any
corruption at preceding hops.

## Header Location

We describe four encapsulation formats in this specification, covering
different deployment scenarios, with and without network virtualization:

1. *INT over IPv4/GRE* - INT headers are carried between the GRE header and the
encapsulated GRE payload.
2. *INT over TCP/UDP* - A shim header is inserted following TCP/UDP
header. INT Headers are carried between this shim header and TCP/UDP payload.
Since v2.0, the spec also supports an option to insert a new UDP header
(followed by INT headers) before the existing L4 header.
This approach doesn’t rely on any tunneling/virtualization mechanism and is
versatile to apply INT to both native and virtualized traffic.
3. *INT over VXLAN* - VXLAN generic protocol extensions [^VXLAN-GPE] are used
to carry INT Headers between the VXLAN header and the encapsulated VXLAN
payload.
4. *INT over Geneve* - Geneve is an extensible tunneling framework, allowing
Geneve options to be defined for INT Headers.

[^VXLAN-GPE]: Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN, [draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-09](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-09), December 2019.

### INT over IPv4/GRE

In case the traffic being monitored is not encapsulated by any virtualization
header, INT over VXLAN or INT over Geneve is not helpful. Instead, a GRE
encapsulation as defined in RFC 2784 [^RFC2784] can be utilized. The INT
metadata header and INT metadata follows the GRE header. In an administrative
domain where INT is used, insertion of the INT metadata header and metadata in
GRE is enabled at the INT source and deletion of INT metadata header
and metadata is enabled at the INT sink by means of configuration.

There are two scenarios when utilizing GRE encapsulation to support INT:

1. If the incoming packet at the source node of the INT domain is GRE
encapsulated, then the source node should add the INT Metadata Header
and Metadata following the GRE header. The sink node of the INT domain
should remove the INT Metadata Header and Metadata stack before forwarding
the GRE encapsulated packet to the destination.

2. If the incoming packet at the source node of the INT domain is not GRE
encapsulated, then the source node should add a GRE encapsulation and insert
the INT Metadata Header and Metadata following the GRE header. The sink node
of the INT domain should remove the GRE encapsulation along with removing
the INT Metadata Header and the Metadata stack before forwarding the packet
to the destination.

Metadata:

The GRE header and fields are defined in RFC 2784 [^RFC2784]. The GRE Protocol
Type value is TBD_INT.

The INT Shim header for GRE option is defined as follows:

* **Type (4b):** This field indicates the type of INT Header following the shim
  header. The Type values are defined in Section [#sec-int-header-types].
* **G (1b):** Indicates whether the GRE headers were inserted to transport INT
  by the INT source.
  - **0:** Original packet (before insertion of INT headers and metadata) had
    GRE encapsulation.
  - **1:** Original packet had no GRE encapsulation, hence the INT source
    inserted GRE.
  - This is a hint that helps the INT sink (when it is not the GRE tunnel endpoint)
    determine whether to remove the GRE headers part of INT decapsulation (if G=1).
* **Rsvd (3b):** reserved for future use, set to zero upon transmission and
  ignored upon reception.
* **Length (8b):** This is the total length of INT metadata header, INT stack
  excluding the shim header in 4-byte words. A non-INT device may read this
  field and skip over INT headers.
* **Next Protocol (16b):** this field contains an EtherType value (defined in
  the IANA registry [^ETYPES])
  indicating the type of the protocol following the INT stack. An implementation
  receiving a packet containing a type value which is not listed in the registry
  should discard the packet.

### INT over TCP/UDP

In case the traffic being monitored is not encapsulated by any virtualization
header, one can also put the INT metadata just after layer 4 headers (TCP/UDP).
The scheme assumes that the non-INT devices between the INT source and the
INT sink either do not parse beyond layer-4 headers or can skip through the
INT stack using the Length field in the INT shim header. If TCP has any options,
the INT stack may come before or after the TCP options but the decision must
be consistent within an INT domain.

Note that INT over UDP can be used even when the packet is encapsulated by VXLAN,
Geneve, or GUE (Generic UDP Encapsulation). INT over TCP/UDP also makes it
easier to add INT stack into outer, inner, or even both layers. In such cases
both INT header stacks carry information for respective layers and need not be
considered interfering with each other.

A field in Ethernet, IP, or TCP/UDP should indicate if the
INT header exists after the TCP/UDP header. We propose three options.

1. UDP destination port field: a new UDP port number (INT_TBD) will be assigned
   by IANA to indicate the existence of INT after UDP. This option supports two
   cases:
  - The original packet already has UDP header either as user application
    protocol or as part of another UDP-based encapsulation such as VXLAN,
    GENEVE, RoCEv2. INT is inserted after the UDP header with the UDP
    destination port number changed to INT_TBD.
    The original destination port number
    is carried in the shim header for the INT sink to restore, when it
    removes the INT stack from the packet.
  - A new UDP header for INT is inserted between IP and the existing L4 header.
    The protocol field of IP header is set to 17 for UDP and the original
    IP protocol value is carried in the INT shim header.
    In the new UDP header, INT_TBD is used as the destination port number.
    It is recommended that the source port number of the new UDP header be
    calculated using a hash of fields from the original packet, for example
    the original outer 5 tuple or the original L4 header fields.
    This is to enable a level of entropy for ECMP/LAG load balancing logic.
    It is recommended that the checksum in the new UDP header be set to zero.
    For IPv6 packets, this falls under the case of tunnel protocols,
    which are allowed to use zero UDP checksums as specified in RFC 6936.
    The existing L4 header will typically include a checksum computed
    using the encapsulating IPv6 header fields, thus offering some protection
    against IPv6 header corruption.

  In both cases, traffic with INT headers is likely to be hashed
  to a different path in the network as the new UDP
  destination port (INT_TBD) becomes part of the outer 5 tuple used by ECMP.

  The INT shim header for UDP has a field NPT (Next Protocol Type) that
  indicates which of the two cases are applied to a given INT packet. In case
  a new UDP header was inserted,
  INT sink must copy the original IP protocol number from the shim header
  to IP header, and strip the newly added UDP header with all INT headers.
  For the case that original packet already had UDP header, INT sink must
  restore the original destination port number from the shim header
  into the UDP header and strip the INT headers.

2. IPv4 DSCP or IPv6 Traffic Class field: A value or a bit can be used to
indicate the existence of INT after TCP/UDP. When the INT source inserts the
INT header into a packet, it sets the reserved value in the field or sets the
bit. The INT source may write the original DSCP value in the INT headers so
that the INT sink can restore the original value. Restoring the original value
is optional.
  - Allocating a bit, as opposed to a value codepoint, will allow the rest of
    DSCP field to be used for QoS, hence allowing the coexistence of DSCP-based
    QoS and INT. If the traffic being monitored is subjected to QoS services
    such as rate limiting, shaping, or differentiated queueing based on DSCP
    field, QoS classification in the network must be programmed to
    ignore the designated bit position to ensure that the INT-enabled traffic
    receives the same treatment as the original traffic being monitored.
  - In brownfield scenarios, however, the network operator may not find a bit
    available to allocate for INT but may still have a fragmented space of 32
    unused DSCP values. The operator can allocate an INT-enabled DSCP value
    for every QoS DSCP value, map the INT-enabled DSCP value to the same
    QoS behavior as the corresponding QoS DSCP value. This may double the
    number of QoS rules but will allow the co-existence of DSCP-based QoS and
    INT even when a single DSCP bit is not available for INT.
  - Within an INT domain, DSCP values used for INT must exclusively be used
    for INT. INT transit and sink nodes must not receive non-INT packets
    marked with DSCP values used for INT. Any time a node forwards a packet
    into the INT domain and there is no INT header present, it must ensure that
    the DSCP/Traffic class value is not the same as any of the values used
    to indicate INT.

3. Probe Marker fields: If DSCP field or values cannot be reserved for INT,
probe marker option could be used. A specific 64-bit value can be inserted
after the TCP/UDP header to indicate the existence of INT after TCP/UDP.
These fields must be
interpreted as unsigned integer values in network byte order. This approach is
a variation of an early IETF draft with existing implementation[^DPP].
[^DPP]: Data-plane probe for in-band telemetry collection, [draft-lapukhov-dataplane-probe-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lapukhov-dataplane-probe-01), June 2016.

   INT probe marker for TCP/UDP:
```
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Probe Marker (1)                      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Probe Marker (2)                      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

   With arbitrary values being inserted after TCP/UDP header as probe markers,
the likelihood of conflicting with user traffic in a data center is
low, but cannot be completely eliminated. To further reduce the chance of
conflict, a deployment could choose to also examine TCP/UDP port numbers
to validate INT probe marker.

Any of the above options may be used in an INT domain, provided that the INT
transit and sink nodes in the INT domain comply with the mechanism chosen
at the INT sources, and are able to correctly identify the presence and location
of INT headers. The above approaches are not intended to interoperate in a
mixed environment, for example it would be incorrect to mark a packet for INT
using both DSCP and probe marker, as INT nodes that only understand
DSCP marking and do not recognize probe markers may incorrectly interpret the
first four bytes of the probe marker as INT shim header.
It is strongly recommended that only one option be used within an INT domain.

We introduce an INT shim header for TCP/UDP. The INT
metadata header and INT metadata stack will be encapsulated between
the shim header and the TCP/UDP payload.

INT shim header for TCP/UDP:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Type  |NPT|R|R|     Length    |  UDP port, IP Proto, or DSCP  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

* **Type (4b):** This field indicates the type of INT Header following the shim
  header.
  The Type values are defined in Section [#sec-int-header-types].
* **NPT (Next Protocol Type, 2b):** This field is meaningful only when the UDP destination
  port number (INT_TBD) is used to indicate the existence of INT. In the other cases,
  this field must be zero. When UDP destination port is INT_TBD, this field may have
  one of the two values:

  - **one (1):** indicates that the original UDP payload follows the INT stack,
    and the last two bytes of the shim header carry the original UDP destination port.
  - **two (2):** indicates that another (the original) L4 header follows
    the INT stack, and the last byte of the shim header carries the IP protocol
    value for the L4 layer.
* **Length (8b):** This is the total length of INT metadata header and INT stack
  in 4-byte words. The length of the shim header (1 word) is NOT counted
  since INT version 2.0.
  A non-INT device may read this field and skip over INT headers.
* **UDP port, IP proto, or DSCP (16b):** The contents of this field differ
  depending on the value of NPT.

  - **NPT=0:** The first byte and the last two bits of this 16b field are reserved,
    set to zero upon transmission and ignored upon reception. The first 6 bits of
    the second byte may optionally carry the original DSCP value.
  - **NPT=1:** The original UDP destination port value.
  - **NPT=2:** The first byte is reserved, set to zero upon transmission and ignored
    upon reception. The second byte carries the original IP protocol value.

The other bits in the shim header are reserved (R) for future use,
set to zero upon transmission and ignored upon reception.

### INT over VXLAN GPE

VXLAN is a common tunneling protocol for network virtualization and is supported
by most software virtual switches and hardware network elements. The VXLAN
header as defined in RFC 7348 is a fixed 8-byte header as shown below.

VXLAN Header:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |R|R|Ver|I|P|B|O|                     Reserved                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

The amount of free space in the VXLAN header allows for carrying minimal network
state information. Hence, we embed INT metadata in a shim header between the
VXLAN header and the encapsulated payload.

The VXLAN header as defined in RFC 7348 does not specify the protocol being
encapsulated and assumes that the payload following the VXLAN header is an
Ethernet payload. Internet draft draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe [^VXLAN-GPE] proposes
changes to the VXLAN header to allow for multi-protocol encapsulation. We use
this VXLAN generic protocol extension draft and propose a new
“Next Protocol” field value for INT.

VXLAN GPE Header:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |R|R|Ver|I|P|B|O|           Reserved            | Next Protocol |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

* **P bit:** Flag bit 5 is defined as the Next Protocol bit. The P bit MUST be
  set to 1 to indicate the presence of the 8-bit next protocol field.

* **Next Protocol Values:**
  * 0x01: IPv4
  * 0x02: IPv6
  * 0x03: Ethernet
  * 0x04: Network Service Header (NSH)
  * 0x05 to 0x7F: Unassigned
  * 0x80 to 0xFF: Unassigned (shim headers)
  * **0x82:** In-band Network Telemetry Header (This value has not been reserved
    by VXLAN GPE specification yet, and is hence subject to change)

When there is one INT Header in the VXLAN GPE stack, the VXLAN GPE header for
the INT Header will have a next protocol value other than INT Header indicating
the payload following the INT Header - typically Ethernet. If there are multiple
INT Headers in the VXLAN GPE stack (for example if both MD and
destination type INT headers are being carried), then all VXLAN GPE shim
headers for the INT Headers other than the last one will carry 0x82 for
their next protocol values, and the VXLAN GPE header for the last INT Header
will carry next protocol value of the original VXLAN payload (e.g., Ethernet).

To embed a variable-length data (i.e., INT metadata) in the VXLAN GPE stack, we
introduce the INT shim header. This header follows each VXLAN GPE header for
INT.

INT shim header for VXLAN GPE encapsulation:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    |   Variable Option Data (INT Metadata Headers and Metadata)    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

* **Type (4b):** This field indicates the type of INT Header following the shim
  header.
  The Type values are defined in Section [#sec-int-header-types].
* **Rsvd (4b):** These 4 bits must be set to zero in order to allign with the
  shim header format recommended by Internet draft draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe,
  which allocates 8 bits for the Type field.
* **Length:** This is the total length of the variable INT option data,
  not including the shim header, in 4-byte words.
* **G:** Indicates whether the original packet (before insertion of INT headers
  and metadata) used a VXLAN or VXLAN GPE encapsulation.
  - **0:** Original packet used VXLAN GPE encapsulation.
  - **1:** Original packet used VXLAN encapsulation.
  - This may be used as a hint that helps the INT sink (when it is not the VTEP)
    determine whether to progress the packet using a VXLAN GPE encapsulation,
    or whether to convert the VXLAN GPE encapsulation back to a VXLAN (without
    GPE) encapsulation.

### INT over Geneve

Geneve is a generic and extensible tunneling framework, allowing for INT
metadata to be carried in TLV format as “Option headers” in the tunnel header.

Geneve Header:
```
    0                   1                   2                   3

Geneve Option for INT:

    |   Variable Option Data (INT Metadata Headers and Metadata)    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Note:

* We do not need to reserve any special values for fields in the base
Geneve header for INT.
* Users may or may not use INT with Geneve along with VNI (network
virtualization), though using INT with Geneve without network virtualization
would be a bit wasteful.
* The Geneve **Option Class** codepoint 0x0103 has been tentatively assigned for
  INT [^IANA-Geneve].
* The Geneve Option **Type** field indicates the type of INT Header in the
  Geneve Option. The Type values are defined in Section [#sec-int-header-types].
* The variable length option data following the Geneve Option Header carries
the actual INT metadata header and metadata.
* The Length field of the Geneve Option header is 5-bits long, which
limits a single Geneve option instance to no more than 124 bytes long (31 * 4).
*Remaining Hop Count* in INT-MD type header has to be set accordingly at the
INT source to ensure that the Geneve option does not overflow. The entire
INT-MD header must fit in a single Geneve option.

## INT-MD Metadata Header Format

In this section, we define the format of the INT-MD metadata header,
and the metadata itself.

INT-MD Metadata Header and Metadata Stack:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3

```

* INT-MD metadata header is 12 bytes long followed by a stack of INT metadata.
  Each metadata is either 4 bytes or 8 bytes in length. Each INT hop adds
  the same length of metadata, except for the source node if there is any
  'source-only' metadata. The total length of the metadata stack is
  variable as different packets may traverse different paths and hence
  different number of INT hops.

* **Ver (4b):** INT metadata header version. Should be 2 for this version.
* **D (1b):** Discard.
    - INT Sink must Discard the packet after Extracting INT-MD metadata.
* **E (1b):** Max Hop Count exceeded.
    - This flag must be set if a node cannot prepend its own metadata due to
      the *Remaining Hop Count* reaching zero.
    - E bit must be set to 0 by INT source
* **M (1b):** MTU exceeded
    - This flag must be set if a node cannot add all of the requested metadata
      because doing so will cause the packet length to exceed egress link MTU.
      In this case, the node must not add any metadata to the packet, and set
      the M bit in the INT header. Note that it is possible for egress MTU
      limitation to prevent INT metadata insertion at multiple hops along a
      path. The M bit simply serves as an indication that INT metadata was not
      inserted at one or more hops and corrective action such as reconfiguring
      MTU at some links may be needed, particularly when INT nodes are not
      participating in path MTU discovery. The M bit is not aimed at readily
      identifying which node(s) did not insert INT metadata due to egress MTU
      limitation. In theory, if this does not occur at consecutive hops,
      it may be possible for the monitoring system to derive which
      node(s) set the M bit based on knowledge of the network topology
      and "Node ID, Ingress interface ID, Egress interface ID" tuples in the INT
      metadata stack.
* **R (12b):** Reserved bits, should be set to 0 by the INT source and ignored
  by other nodes.
* **Hop ML (5b):** Per-hop Metadata Length. This is the length of metadata
  including the Domain Specific Metadata in 4-Byte words to be inserted at
  each INT transit hop.
    - *Hop ML* is set by the INT source for transit and sink hops to abide by.
      If an INT domain uses 'source-only' Domain Specific Metadata,
      defined below, the length of the source-only Domain Specific Metadata
      is *excluded* from the *Hop ML*.
    - The largest value of *Hop ML* for baseline and domain specific
      metadata is 31.
* **Remaining Hop Count (8b):** The remaining number of hops that are allowed to
    add their metadata to the packet.
    - Upon creation of an INT metadata header, the INT Source must set this
      value to the maximum number of hops that are allowed to add metadata
      instance(s) to the packet. Each INT node on the path, including
      the INT Source as well as INT Transit Hops, must decrement the
      *Remaining Hop Count* if and when it pushes its local metadata onto the
      stack.
    - When a packet is received with the *Remaining Hop Count* equal to 0, the
      node must ignore the INT instructions in the *Instruction Bitmap* and
      *DS Instruction*, pushing no new metadata onto the stack, and the node
      must set the E bit.

* **Instruction Bitmap:** Each bit corresponds to a specific standard metadata
  as specified in Section [#what-to-monitor].
  - bit0 (MSB): Node ID
  - bit1: Level 1 Ingress Interface ID (16 bits) + Egress Interface ID (16 bits)
  - bit2: Hop latency
  - bit3: Queue ID (8 bits) + Queue occupancy (24 bits)
  - bit4: Ingress timestamp (8 bytes)
  - bit5: Egress timestamp (8 bytes)
  - bit6: Level 2 Ingress Interface ID + Egress Interface ID (4 bytes each)
  - bit7: Egress interface Tx utilization
  - bit8: Buffer ID (8 bits) + Buffer occupancy (24 bits)
  - bit15: Checksum Complement
  - The remaining bits are reserved.

  The semantics of Queue occupancy and Buffer occupancy is the default semantics of
  those two metadata. Additional semantics as needed for different implementation
  can be defined in the metadata semantics YANG model [^metadata-yang].

  Bits 0 - 14 are Baseline INT Instructions. Each instruction bit that is set
  requests 4 bytes of metadata to be inserted at each hop, except for bits 4-6,
  each requires 8 bytes of metadata. Per-hop metadata length (*Hop ML*) is set
  accordingly at the INT source.

* **Domain Specific ID (16b):** The unique ID of the INT Domain.
  If the *Domain Specific ID* matches any Domain ID known to this node, then
  additional processing of the Domain Specific Flags (*DS Flags*) and Domain
  Specific Instruction (*DS Instruction*) is required.

  The *Domain Specific ID* value 0x0000 is the default, known to all INT nodes.
  For this value, all *DS Instruction* bits are treated as reserved. Operators
  can assign values in the range 0x0001 to 0xFFFF.

* **DS Instruction (16b):** Instruction bitmap specific to the INT domain
  identified by the *Domain Specific ID*. Each bit that is set requests that
  Domain Specific Metadata be appended to the Baseline Metadata before the
  Checksum Complement is inserted.

  Some instruction bits can be defined as 'source-only' metadata by the INT domain. Those metadata
  will be inserted only by the INT source, not by INT transit or sink nodes.
  In a sense, 'source-only' bits do not serve as instructions for downstream INT nodes
  to follow. The INT source sets the bits to indicate which source-only DS metadata it's adding
  such that the monitoring system (or any consumer of the metadata) knows how to parse and use
  the data.

  The amount of Domain Specific Metadata added by each hop must be a multiple of 4 bytes,
  determined from the *DS Instruction*. In case of INT transit, the amount
  must be consistent with the per-hop metadata length (*Hop ML*) set by the INT source.
  The amount of Domain Specific Metadata added by the INT source can be larger than
  the amount added by a transit hop and
  the delta must match the total size of 'source-only' Domain Specific Metadata.
  Although the delta is excluded in *Hop ML*, it must be counted in the INT length field of
  the INT shim header.

* Each INT Transit node along the path that supports INT, and the INT Source
  node as well, adds its own metadata values as specified in the *Instruction
  Bitmap* and *DS Instruction*, immediately after the INT metadata header.
  - When adding new metadata, each node must prepend its metadata in
    front of the metadata that are already added by the upstream nodes.
    This is similar to the push operation on a stack data structure.
    Hence, the most recently
    added metadata appears at the top of the stack. The node must add
    metadata in the order of bits set in the *Instruction Bitmap* and *DS
    Instruction*, except that the Checksum Complement is last.
  - If a node is unable to provide a metadata value specified in the
    instruction bitmap because its value is not available, it must add a
    special all-ones reserved value indicating "invalid" (4 or 8 bytes of 0xFF
    depending on metadata length).
  - Reserved bits in the *Instruction Bitmap* are to be handled similarly. If an
    INT transit hop receives a reserved bit set in the *Instruction Bitmap* (e.g.
    set by a INT source that is running a newer version), the transit hop must
    either add corresponding metadata filled with the reserved value 0xFFFFFFFF
    or must not add any INT metadata to the packet. This means that an
    instruction bit marked reserved in this specification may be
    used for a 4B metadata in a subsequent minor version while still being
    backward compatible with this specification. However, an instruction bit
    marked reserved in this specification may be used for a 8B metadata only
    in the next major version, breaking backward compatibility and requiring all
    INT nodes to be upgraded to the new major version. For example
    a version 2.0 INT node cannot operate alongside version 3.0 INT nodes
    if a new 8B metadata is introduced in version 3.0, as the version 2.0
    INT node could insert 0xFFFFFFFF reserved value for a 8B metadata field.
  - If the *Domain Specific ID* does not match any Domain ID known to this node,
    then the node is required to either:
    - Pad the node's INT Metadata stack with the special all-ones reserved value
      for a Domain Specific Metadata length, calculated by subtracting from the
      *Hop ML* a length computed from all bits in the 16-bit *Instruction
      Bitmap*, or
    - Skip INT processing altogether and not insert any metadata into the packet.
  - An INT-capable node may be limited in the maximum number
    of instructions it can process and/or maximum length of metadata it can
    insert in data packets. An INT hop that cannot process all instructions
    must still insert *Hop ML* \* 4 bytes, with all-ones
    reserved value (4 or 8 bytes of 0xFF depending on the length of metadata)
    for the metadata corresponding to instructions it cannot process. An
    INT hop that cannot insert Per-hop Metadata Length \* 4 bytes must skip
    INT processing altogether and not insert any metadata in the packet. This
    ensures that each INT node adds either zero bytes or
    *Hop ML* \* 4 bytes to the packet.
  - If an INT hop does not add metadata to a packet due to any of the
    above reasons, it must not decrement the *Remaining Hop Count* in the INT
    metadata header.

* The INT Sink node has the option to add its local telemetry metadata in either
  of the following ways, with differing implementation dependent impact:

  1. The INT Sink's local telemetry metadata may be added to the INT-MD metadata
     stack by following the same procedures described just above for INT
     Transit nodes. The metadata stack with the INT Sink's local telemetry
     metadata is included in the Telemetry Report, typically in a truncated
     packet fragment.

  2. The INT Sink's local telemetry metadata may be added to the Telemetry
     Report's *Variable Optional Baseline Metadata* and *Variable Optional
     Domain Specific Metadata*, following procedures similar to those described
     for INT-MX nodes in Section [#int-mx-header], with the following addition
     and restriction:
     - *RepMdBits* bit 15 is also cleared since the Checksum Complement is not
       applicable in the *Individual Report Header*. If the packet is dropped,
       then *RepMdBits* bit 15 may be set since the bit is repurposed from its
       usage in the INT-MD metadata header.
     - The 'source-only' metadata is reported in the metadata stack, typically
       in a truncated packet fragment, rather than the *Variable Optional Domain
       Specific Metadata*.

  The expectation is that each INT node implementation will only support one of
  these, while monitoring systems should support both.

* Summary of the field usage
  - The INT Source must set the following fields:
    - *Ver*, *D*, *M*, *Hop ML*, *Remaining Hop Count*,
      and *Instruction Bitmap*.
    - INT Source should set all reserved bits to zero.
    - INT Source may set the Domain-specific fields.
  - Intermediate transit nodes can set the following fields:
    - *E*, *M*, *Remaining Hop Count*, and *DS Flags* fields.
    - Intermediate transit nodes must not modify the *Hop ML*, *Instruction
      Bitmap*, *Domain Specific ID* and *DS Instruction* in the INT-MD header.
* The length (in bytes) of the INT metadata stack must always
be a multiple of (*Hop ML* \* 4), plus the size of 'source-only' Domain Specific
Metadata if added by the source. The total stack length can be determined
by subtracting the total INT fixed header sizes (12 bytes)
from (shim header length \* 4).

## INT-MX Header Format { #int-mx-header }

In this section, we define the format of the INT-MX header.

INT-MX Header:
```
     0                   1                   2                   3

    |      Optional Domain Specific 'Source-Inserted' Metadata      |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

* The INT-MX header is 12 bytes long. Each metadata requested in the
  INT-MX Header instruction is either 4 bytes or 8 bytes in length. Each INT
  node in the forwarding path will send the requested metadata to the
  monitoring system in the Telemetry Report.

  Details of the metadata semantics and format of the Telemetry Report can
  be accessed in the Telemetry Report Format Specification [^telem-report].

[^telem-report]: [Telemetry Report Format Specification Version 2.0](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-applications/blob/master/docs/telemetry_report_v2_0.pdf), May 2020.

* **Ver (4b):** INT-MX header version. Should be 2 for this version.

* **D (1b):** Discard.
    - INT Sink must Discard the packet after sending the metadata requested
      in the INT-MX header to the monitoring system.

* **R (27b):** Reserved bits.
    - Should be set to 0 by INT Source and ignored by other nodes.

* **Instruction Bitmap:** Each bit corresponds to a specific standard metadata
  as specified in Section [#what-to-monitor].
  - bit0 (MSB): Node ID
  - bit1: Level 1 Ingress Interface ID (16 bits) + Egress Interface ID (16 bits)
  - bit2: Hop latency
  - bit3: Queue ID (8 bits) + Queue occupancy (24 bits)
  - bit4: Ingress timestamp (8 bytes)
  - bit5: Egress timestamp (8 bytes)
  - bit6: Level 2 Ingress Interface ID + Egress Interface ID (4 bytes each)
  - bit7: Egress interface Tx utilization
  - bit8: Buffer ID (8 bits) + Buffer occupancy (24 bits)
  - The remaining bits are reserved.

  The semantics of Queue occupancy and Buffer occupancy is the default semantics of
  those two metadata. Additional semantics as needed for different implementation
  can be defined in the metadata semantics YANG model [^metadata-yang].

  Bits 0 - 14 are Baseline INT Instructions that will be reported in *RepMdBits*
  and *Variable Optional Baseline Metadata* in the Telemetry Report. Each
  instruction bit that is set requests 4 bytes of metadata to be sent to the
  monitoring system at each hop, except for bits 4-6, each requires 8 bytes of
  metadata.

* **Domain Specific ID (16b):** The unique ID of the INT Domain.
  If the *Domain Specific ID* matches any Domain ID known to this node, then
  additional processing of the Domain Specific Flags (*DS Flags*) and Domain
  Specific Instruction (*DS Instruction*) is required.

  The *Domain Specific ID* value 0x0000 is the default, known to all INT nodes.
  For this value, all *DS Instruction* bits are treated as reserved. Operators
  can assign values in the range 0x0001 to 0xFFFF.

* **DS Instruction (16b):** Instruction bitmap specific to the INT domain
  identified by the *Domain Specific ID*. When a bit is defined for a particular
  domain, in addition to the metadata semantics and syntax, the definition must
  specify the behavior with respect to the following properties:

    - **DS Instruction Mode:**
      - **Export**: Each bit that is set requests that each node send this
        metadata in its telemetry report. This is similar to the bits in the
        *Instruction Bitmap*, except that the metadata syntax and semantics are
        defined in a domain specific manner.
      - **Source-Inserted**: Each bit that is set represents metadata that is
        inserted by the source node into the *Optional Domain Specific
        'Source-Inserted' Metadata* in this packet.

    - **Source-Inserted Metadata Reporting Requirement:**
      - **All Nodes**: Each node including the source, transit, and sink nodes
        should report this source-inserted metadata to the monitoring system
        along with the node's own metadata. One example of a type of metadata
        that would benefit from *All Nodes* behavior is a sequence number, which
        can be used by the monitoring system to assist in correlation of
        multiple telemetry reports for the same flow. Note that there are two
        ways to include the 'source-inserted' metadata in the Telemetry Report,
        described below.
      - **Sink Node**: The sink node should report this source-inserted metadata
        to the monitoring system along with the node's own metadata. One example
        of a type of metadata that would benefit from *Sink Node* behavior is a
        timestamp, which could be used to determine the latency experienced by a
        packet from the source node to the sink node.
      - **None**: This source-inserted metadata is meant to be consumed by other
        nodes, and need not be included in any of the telemetry reports directed
        to the monitoring system.

    - **Source-Inserted Metadata Mutability:**
      - **Source-Only**: The source node inserts the metadata. Transit and sink
        nodes must not change the value of this source-inserted metadata.
      - **Cumulative**: Transit and sink nodes may update or replace the value
        of the source-inserted metadata.

  The amount of Domain Specific Metadata sent by each hop must be a multiple of
  4 bytes, determined from the *DS Instruction*, as described below.

* **Optional Domain Specific 'Source-Inserted' Metadata:** The metadata
  corresponding to 'source-inserted' *DS Instruction* bits follows the
  *DS Instruction* and the *DS Flags* fields in the INT-MX header. The length
  of this field must be counted in the INT length field of the INT shim header.

* Each INT node along the path that supports INT-MX (Source, Transit and Sink
  nodes) sends its own metadata values, based on the *Instruction Bitmap* and
  *DS Instruction* in the INT-MX header, as follows:

     - Copy the *Instruction Bitmap* and *DS Instruction* from the INT-MX header
       to *RepMdBits* and *DSMdBits*, respectively, in the Telemetry Report
       [^telem-report]. Then modify *RepMdBits* and *DSMdBits* as described in
       the following bullets.

     - If INT-MX *Instruction Bitmap* bit 0 was set, clear *RepMdBits* bit 0
       since the *Node ID* is already included in the common *Telemetry Report
       Group Header* that precedes the individual reports.

     - If a node is unable to provide a metadata value specified in the
       instruction bitmap because its value is not available, or because it
       corresponds to a reserved bit, the node must ensure that the
       corresponding bit in *RepMdbits* and/or *DSMdBits* is not set in the
       Telemetry Report sent to the monitoring system.

     - If the *Domain Specific ID* does not match any Domain ID known to this
       node, then the node is required to either:
       - Send the metadata corresponding to *Instruction Bitmap* and ensure that
         *DSMdBits* is not set in the Telemetry Report, or
       - Not send any of its own metadata to the monitoring systems.

     - The INT node should make every effort to include domain specific
       'source-inserted' metadata (from the INT-MX header) in the Telemetry
       Report, if that metadata's *Source-Inserted Metadata Reporting
       Requirement* is *All Nodes*, or *Sink Node* if this is the sink node.
       Two ways to accomplish this are described, with differing implementation
       dependent impact:
       a. The truncated packet in the *Individual Report Inner Contents*
          includes the INT-MX header with embedded 'source-inserted' metadata,
          or
       b. The embedded 'source-inserted' metadata from the INT-MX header is
          copied into the *Variable Optional Domain Specific Metadata* in the
          *Individual Report Main Contents*. Note that in order to achieve this,
          the node must understand the *Domain Specific ID* and corresponding
          *DSMdBits* definition, so that it can place that metadata in the
          proper order relative to other domain specific metadata. The
          corresponding bits in *DSMdBits* must remain set so that the
          monitoring system (or any consumer of the metadata) knows how to parse
          and use the data.

       Although typically only one of these ways would be applied to a given
       packet at a specific node, the combination of both of the above is
       allowed. The expectation is that for each role (source, transit, sink),
       each INT node implementation will rely on one of these to report
       'source-inserted' metadata, while monitoring systems should support both.

       If the 'source-inserted' metadata is *not* copied into the *Variable
       Optional Domain Specific Metadata*, then the corresponding bits in
       *DSMdBits* must be cleared.

       Due to backward compatibility implications, domain administrators need
       to be careful when leaving some bits in *DSMdBits* reserved, with regard
       to defining any of those bits as 'source-inserted' in the future.

     - An INT node may be limited in the maximum number of instructions it can
       process and/or maximum length of metadata it can gather for each data
       packet. An INT hop that cannot process all instructions must send to the
       monitoring system the metadata it can process, updating the *RepMdBits*
       and *DSMdBits* fields appropriately in the Telemetry Report.

     - The value to be placed in the *MD Length* field must be computed based on
       the resulting values of *RepMdBits* and *DSMdBits*.

     - The *Variable Optional Baseline Metadata* and *Variable Optional Domain
       Specific Metadata* in the Telemetry Report are populated based on the
       resulting values of *RepMdBits* and *DSMdBits*.

* Summary of the field usage
  - The INT Source must set the following fields:
    - *Ver*, *D* and *Instruction Bitmap*.
    - INT Source should set all reserved bits to zero.
    - INT Source may set the Domain-specific fields.
  - Intermediate transit nodes may set bits in the *DS Flags* field.
    Intermediate transit nodes must not modify the *Instruction Bitmap*,
    *Domain Specific ID* and *DS Instruction* in the INT-MX header.

* The length (in bytes) of the INT metadata sent to the monitoring system
must always be a multiple of 4B.

# Examples

This section shows example INT Headers with two hosts (Host1 and Host2),
communicating over a network path composed of three network switches
(Switch1, Switch2 and Switch3) as shown below.

```
                 ==> packet P travels from Host1 to Host2 ==>
Host1 --------> Switch1 ---------> Switch2 ---------> Switch3 --------> Host2
```

Detailed assumptions made for this example are as follows

* INT source requests each INT hop to insert node ID and queue occupancy
(For the sake of illustration we only consider node ID and queue occupancy
being inserted at each hop. Queue IDs are typically defined per port, hence
in a real use-case queue occupancy is likely to be collected along with egress
interface ID)
* There are three INT nodes (hops) on the path, and all the nodes expose
  both metadata (node ID and queue occupancy).
* The maximum number of hops (network diameter) is 8.
* The values of INT metadata header fields in this example are as follows:
  - *Ver* = 2
  - *D* = 0 (Packet is not a clone/copy, hence the Sink must not Discard)
  - *E* = 0 (Max Hop Count not exceeded)
  - *M* = 0 (MTU not exceeded at any node)
  - Per-hop Metadata Length = 2 (for node id & queue occupancy)
  - *Remaining Hop Count* starts at 8, decremented by 1 at each hop

## Example with INT-MD over TCP

We consider a scenario where host1 sends a TCP packet to host2. The ToR switch
of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds INT-MD headers and its own
metadata in the packet. Switch2 prepends its metadata. Finally, the ToR
switch of host2 (Switch3) acts as the INT sink and removes INT-MD headers before
forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the IPv4
header. We use the value of 0x17 for IPv4.DSCP to indicate the existence of
INT headers.

IP Header:
```

## Example with INT-MX over TCP

We consider a scenario where host1 sends a TCP packet to host2. The ToR switch
of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds INT-MX header in the packet.
Switch2 processes the INT-MX header. Finally, the ToR switch of host2 (Switch3)
acts as the INT sink and removes INT-MX header before forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the IPv4
header. We use the value of 0x17 for IPv4.DSCP to indicate the existence of
INT headers.

## Example with new UDP header and INT-MD inserted before TCP

As before we consider a scenario where host1 sends a TCP packet to host2.
The ToR switch
of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds a new UDP header,
INT-MD headers and its own metadata in the packet.
Switch2 prepends its metadata. Finally, the ToR
switch of host2 (Switch3) acts as the INT sink and removes the UDP and
INT-MD headers before forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the IPv4

## Example with new IP and UDP headers and INT-MX inserted before IPSec

We consider a scenario where host1 sends an IPSec transport mode packet to
host2.
The ToR switch of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds new IP and
UDP headers and a new INT-MX header in the packet. Switch2 processes the
INT-MX Header.
Finally, the ToR switch of host2 (Switch3) acts as the INT sink and removes
the UDP and INT-MX headers before forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the outer IPv4
header. We use INT_TBD for UDP.Destination_Port to indicate the existence of
INT headers.

## Example with INT-MD over IPv4/GRE (Original packet IPv4)

In this scenario host1 sends an IPv4 packet to host2.
The ToR switch of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It does IPv4/GRE
encapsulation and inserts INT-MD headers before the inner (original) IPv4.
Switch2 prepends its metadata. Finally, the ToR switch of host2 (Switch3)
acts as the INT sink and removes the INT-MD headers and decapsulates outer
IPv4/GRE  before forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the
outer IPv4 header. The G bit of INT shim is set to 1 to indicate that
GRE was inserted by the INT source.

## Example with INT-MD over IPv4/GRE (Original packet CE or IP)

In this scenario host1 sends an IPv4 packet to host2.
The ToR switch of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds an Ethernet
(L2) header, does IPv4/GRE encapsulation and inserts INT-MD headers before the
inner (original) packet that starts with an Ethernet header. Switch2 prepends
its metadata. Finally, the ToR switch of host2 (Switch3) acts as the INT sink
and removes the INT-MD headers and decapsulates outer L2 header, outer IPv4/GRE
before forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the
outer Ethernet header. The G bit of INT shim is set to 1 to indicate that
GRE was inserted by the INT source.

## Example with INT-MD over VXLAN GPE

We now consider a scenario where Host1 and Host2 use VXLAN encapsulation.
Host1 acts as VXLAN tunnel endpoint and INT source, inserts VXLAN and INT-MD
headers with instruction bits corresponding to the network state to be
reported at intermediate switches. In this example, Host1 itself does
not insert any INT metadata. Intermediate switches parse through VXLAN
header and populate the INT metadata. Host2 acts as INT sink and VXLAN
tunnel endpoint, removes INT-MD and VXLAN headers.

The packet headers received at Host 2 are as follows, starting with the VXLAN
GPE header (encapsulating ethernet, IP and UDP headers are not shown here):

## Example with INT-MX over Geneve

Finally, we consider a scenario where Host1 and Host2 use Geneve encapsulation.
Host1 acts as Geneve tunnel endpoint and INT source, inserts Geneve and INT-MX
headers with instruction bits corresponding to the network state to be
reported at intermediate switches. In this example, Host1 does not send INT
metadata to the monitoring system. Intermediate switches parse through Geneve
header, process the INT-MX header and send the INT metadata requested
to the monitoring system. Host2 acts as INT sink and Geneve
tunnel endpoint, removes INT-MX and Geneve headers.

Following are the Geneve and INT Headers attached to the packet received by
Host2.

Geneve Header:
```

## Example with INT-MX including domain specific source-inserted metadata

We consider a scenario similar to Section [#example-mx-udp-tcp], with the addition
of 'source-inserted' metadata that consists of a Sequence Number with current
value 15 and a Flow ID with current value 0x12345678. The *Domain Specific ID*
value is 0xabcd.

INT Shim Header for UDP, INT type is INT-MX (3) and
NPT (Next Protocol Type) is 2 indicating another L4 header follows INT.
IP proto is 6 to indicate that TCP follows INT:
```

## Example with INT-MD including domain specific source-only metadata

We consider a scenario where Host1 is on a wireless network behind a NAT
and its identity can not be confirmed by port location.  Host1 does not support
INT.  The gateway acts at the INT source, inserting the header and the MAC address
of Host1.  Intermediate switches populate the INT metadata while preserving
the source-only domain specific metadata. This example can work with any of
the above encapsulation methods such as UDP encapsulation.

The MAC address from host1 is copied from the source address in the Ethernet frame.
The MAC is a 6 byte id.  Since the INT metadata header is measured in blocks of 4 bytes,
the last 2 bytes are reserved.  For example if a source device's MAC address is
"a6:1a:f6:b1:64:7d", the source-only INT metadata would be 0xA61AF6B1647d0000.

Following is the INT-MD Header attached to the packet transmitted by
the hop2 switch.

Details of the Transparent Security domain specific model can be accessed
in the Transparent Security INT header reference definition
[^transparent-security-INT].

INT Metadata Header and Metadata Stack. The *Domain
Specific ID* is 0x5453 ('TS' in ascii), bit 0 is set in the domain bitmap to

# Appendix: An extensive (but not exhaustive) set of Metadata {@h1:"A"}

Here we list a set of exemplary metadata that future versions of the spec may
support as well as those are supported in the current spec.

## Node-level

* Node id
  : The unique ID of an INT node.
    This is generally administratively assigned. Node IDs must be unique
    within an INT domain.
* Control plane state version number
  : Whenever a control-plane state changes (e.g., IP FIB update), the node's
    control plane can also update this version number in the data plane. INT
    packets may use these version numbers to determine which control-plane state
    was active at the time packets were forwarded.

## Ingress

* Ingress interface identifier
  : The interface on which the INT packet was received. A packet may be received
    on an arbitrary stack of interface constructs starting with a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be received on a physical port that belongs to a
    link aggregation port group, which in turn is part of a Layer 3 Switched
    Virtual Interface, and at Layer 3 the packet may be received in a tunnel.
    Although the entire interface stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of ingress interface
    identifiers. The semantics of interface identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the interface type it reports at each of the two levels.
* Ingress timestamp
  : The device local time when the INT packet was received on the **_ingress_**
    physical or logical port.
* Ingress interface RX pkt count
  : Total # of packets received so far (since device initialization or counter
    reset) on the ingress physical port or logical interface where the INT
    packet was received.
* Ingress interface RX byte count
  : Total # of bytes received so far on the ingress physical port or logical
    interface where the INT packet was received.
* Ingress interface RX drop count
  : Total # of packet drops occurred so far on the ingress physical port or
    logical interface where the INT packet was received.
* Ingress interface RX utilization
  : Current utilization of the ingress physical port or logical interface where
    the INT packet was received. The exact mechanism (bin bucketing, moving
    average, etc.) is device specific and while the latter is clearly superior
    to the former, the INT framework leaves those decisions to device vendors.

[]{tex-cmd: "\newpage"}

## Egress

* Egress interface identifier
  : The interface on which the INT packet was sent out. A packet may be transmitted
    on an arbitrary stack of interface constructs ending at a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be transmitted on a tunnel, out of a Layer 3
    Switched Virtual Interface, on a Link Aggregation Group, out of a
    particular physical port belonging to the Link Aggregation Group.
    Although the entire interface stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of egress interface
    identifiers. The semantics of interface identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the interface type it reports at each of the two levels.
* Egress timestamp
  : The device local time when the INT packet was processed by the egress
    physical port or logical interface.
* Egress interface TX pkt count
  : Total # of packets forwarded so far (since device initialization or counter
    reset) through the egress physical port or logical interface where the INT
    packet was also forwarded.
* Egress interface TX byte count
  : Total # of bytes forwarded so far through the egress physical port or
    logical interface where the INT packet was forwarded.
* Egress interface TX drop count
  : Total # of packet drops occurred so far on the egress physical port or
    logical interface where the INT packet was forwarded.
* Egress interface TX utilization
  : Current utilization of the egress interface via which the INT packet was
    sent out.

## Buffer Information

* Queue id
  : The id of the queue the device used to serve the INT packet.
* Instantaneous queue length
  : The instantaneous length (in bytes, cells, or packets) of the queue the INT
    packet has observed in the device while being forwarded.  The units used
    need not be consistent across an INT domain, but care must be taken to
    ensure that there is a known, consistent mapping of {device, queue} values
    to their respective unit {packets, bytes, cells}.
* Average queue length
  : The average length (in bytes, cells, or packets) of the queue via which the
    INT packet was served.  The calculation mechanism of this value is device
    specific.
* Queue drop count
  : Total # of packets dropped from the queue.

The metadata below are introduced to capture the buffer occupancy INT packet
observes in the device while being forwarded. Use case is when buffer is
shared between multiple queues.

* Buffer id
  : The id of the buffer the device used to serve the INT packet.

[]{tex-cmd: "\newpage"}

* Instantaneous buffer occupancy
  : The instantaneous value (in bytes, or cells) of the buffer occupancy the INT
    packet has observed in the device while being forwarded.  The units used
    need not be consistent across an INT domain, but care must be taken to
    ensure that there is a known, consistent mapping of {device, buffer} values
    to their respective unit {bytes, cells}.
* Average buffer occupancy
  : The average value (in bytes or cells) of the buffer occupancy that the INT
    packet was observed. The calculation mechanism of this value is device
    specific.

## Miscellaneous

* Checksum Complement
  : This field enables a Checksum-neutral update when INT is encapsulated over
    an L4 protocol that uses a Checksum field, such as TCP or UDP.
