# Introduction

Inband Network Telemetry (“INT”) is a framework designed to allow the
collection and reporting of network state, by the data plane, without requiring
intervention or work by the control plane in collecting and deliverying
the state from the data plane. In the INT architectural model,
packets may contain header fields that are interpreted as “telemetry
instructions” by network devices.
INT traffic sources  (applications, end-host networking stacks,
hypervisors, NICs, send-side ToRs, etc.) can embed the instructions either in
normal data packets, cloned copies of the data packets or in special probe packets.
Alternatively, the instructions may be
programmed in the network data plane to match on particular network flows
and to execute the instructions on the matched flows.

These instructions tell an INT-capable device what state to collect.
The network state information may be directly exported by the data plane
to the telemetry monitoring system, or can be
written into the packet as it traverses the
network. When the information is embedded in the packets, INT traffic sinks
retrieve (and optionally report) the collected results of these instructions,
allowing the traffic sinks to monitor the exact data plane state that the
packets “observed” while being forwarded.

Some examples of traffic sink behavior are described below:

* OAM – the traffic sink might simply collect the encoded network state, then
export that state to an external controller.  This export could be in a raw
format, or could be combined with basic processing (such as compression,
deduplication, truncation).

* Real-time control or feedback loops – traffic sinks might use the encoded
data plane information  to feed back control information to traffic sources,
which could in turn use this information to make changes to traffic engineering
or packet forwarding.  (Explicit congestion notification schemes are an example
of these types of feedback loops).

* Network Event Detection - If the collected path state indicates a condition
that requires immediate attention or resolution (such as severe congestion or
violation of certain data-plane invariances), the traffic sinks could generate
immediate actions to respond to the network events, forming a feedback control
loop either in a centralized or a fully decentralized fashion (a la TCP).

The INT architectural model is intended to be generic and enables a
number of interesting high level applications, such as:

* Network troubleshooting
  - Traceroute, micro-burst detection, packet history (a.k.a. postcards[^Postcard])
* Advanced congestion control
* Advanced routing
  - Utilization-aware routing (For example, HULA[^HULA], CLOVE[^CLOVE])
* Network data plane verification

A number of use case descriptions and evaluations are described in the Millions
of Little Minions paper [^Minions].

# Terminology

* **Monitoring System **: A system that collects telemetry data sent from
different network devices. The monitoring system components may be physically
distributed but logically centrallized.

* **INT Header**: A packet header that carries INT information. There are two
types of INT Headers -- *Hop-by-hop* and *Destination* (See Section
[#sec-int-header-types]).

* **INT Packet**: A packet containing an INT Header.

* **INT Instruction**: Instructions indicating which
INT Metadata (defined below) to collect at each INT switch. The instructions
are either configured at each INT-capable device's Flow Watchlist
or written into the INT Header.

* **Flow Watchlist**: A dataplane table that matches on packet headers
and insert or apply INT instructions on each matched flow. A flow is a set of
packets having the same values on the selected header fields.

* **INT Source**: A trusted entity that creates and inserts INT Headers into the
packets it sends. A Flow Watchlist is configured to select the flows in which
INT headers are to be inserted.

* **INT Sink**: A trusted entity that extracts the INT Headers and collects the
path state contained in the INT Headers. The INT Sink is responsible for
removing INT Headers so as to make INT transparent to upper layers. (Note that
this does not preclude having nested or hierarchical INT domains.) The INT Sink
can decide to send the collected information to the monitoring system.

* **INT Transit Hop**: A networking device that collects metadata from the data plane
by following the INT Instructions. Based on the instruction, the data may be
directly exported to the telemetry monitoring system
or embedded into the INT Header of the packet.

Note that one physical device
may play multiple roles -- INT Source, Transit, Sink -- at the same time
for the same or different flows. For example, an INT Source device may
embed its own metadata into the packet, playing the roles of INT Transit as well.

* **INT Metadata**: Information that an INT Source or an INT Transit Hop device
inserts into the INT Header. Examples of metadata are described in section
[#sec-what-to-monitor].

* **INT Domain**: A set of inter-connected INT devices under the same
administration. This specification defines the behavior and packet header
formats for interoperability between INT switches from different vendors in
an INT domain. The INT devices within the same domain must be configured in
a consistent way to ensure interoperability between the devices.
Operators of an INT domain should deploy INT Sink capability at domain edges to
prevent INT information from leaking out of the domain.

# INT Modes of Operation
Since INT was first introduced at P4.org in 2015, a number of variations of INT
have been evolved and discussed in IETF and industry communities.
Also the term 'INT' has been used to broadly indicate data plane
telemetry in general, not limited to the original classic INT where both instructions
and metadata are embedeed in the data packets. Hence we define different modes of
INT operations based on the following criteria:

* whether INT is applied to real data packets vs synthetic (clone or probe) packets.
* the degree of packet modifications, i.e., what to embed in the packets.

The different modes of operations are described in detail below, and summarized
in Figure [#fig-int-modes].

## INT Applied to Real Data Packets

In this category, the original data packets are monitored and may be modified
to carry INT instructions and metadata.
There are three variations based on the level of packet modifications.

* **INT-XD** (eXport Data): network devices directly export metadata from
their dataplane to the monitoring system based on the INT instructions configured
at their Flow Watchlists. No packet Modification is needed. This mode was also
known as "Postcard" mode in the previous versions of Telemetry Report spec,
originally inspired by [^Postcard].


* **INT-MX** (eMbed instruct(X)ions): INT Source devices embed INT instructions in
the packet header, each following Source/Transit device directly sends the metadata
to the monitoring system by following the instructions embedded in the packets.
INT Sink devices strip the instruction header before forwarding the packet to the
receiver.
Packet modification is limited to the instruction header, the packet size doesn't
grow as the packet traverses more Transit devices.
This mode is inspired by IOAM's "Immediate Export" [^IOAM].

* **INT-MD** (eMbed Data): in this mode both INT instructions and metadata are
written into the packets. This is the classic INT where 1) INT Source embeds
instructions, 2) INT Source & Transit embed metadata, and 3) INT Sink strips
the instructions and aggregated metadata out of the packet and
(selectivly) send the data to the monitoring system.
Packet is modified the most in this mode while it minimizes the overhead
at the monitoring system to collate reports from multiple devices.

## INT Applied to Synthetic Traffic

In this category, INT Source devices generate synthetic traffic either by
clonning the original data packets or by generating special probe packets.
INT is applied to the synthetic traffic.

The XD mode doesn't make sense for synthetic traffic. The MX mode is
technically possible but doesn't add much value. Hence we define two MD modes
as follows.

* INT-CLONE-MD (eMbed Data): INT Source devices create extra traffic through
cloning the original packets and then embedding the INT instructions and metadata into
the clones only. INT Transit devices accumulate metadata only on the clones,
INT Sink devices may send telemetry reports before discarding the clones.
Compared to INT-MD, INT-CLONE-MD produces extra traffic
and may not capture actual network state that the orignal packets experience, while
this mode avoids direct modification on the original data packets.
This mode is similar to IFA [^IFA].

* INT-PROBE-MD (eMbed Data): similar to INT-CLONE-MD, but INT is applied to
special probe packets instead of clone packets.



**NOTE: the rest of the spec is assuming INT-MD as the default mode, unless
specified otherwise.**

# What To Monitor

In theory, one may be able to define and collect any switch-internal
information using the INT approach. In practice, however, it seems useful to
define a small baseline set of metadata that can be made available on a wide
variety of devices:  the metadata listed in this section comprises such a set.
As the INT specification evolves, we expect to add more metadata to this
INT specification.

The exact meaning of the following metadata (e.g., the unit of timestamp
values, the precise definition of hop latency, queue occupancy or buffer 
occupancy) can vary from one device to another for any number of reasons, 
including the heterogeneity of device architecture, feature sets, 
resource limits, etc. Thus, defining the exact meaning of each metadata 
is beyond the scope of this document. Instead we assume that the semantics 
of metadata for each device model used in a deployment is communicated 
with the entities interpreting/analyzing the reported data in an out-of-band 
fashion.

## Switch-level Information

* Switch id
  - The unique ID of a switch (generally administratively assigned). Switch IDs
must be unique within an INT domain.

## Ingress Information

* Ingress port identifier
  - The port on which the INT packet was received. A packet may be received
    on an arbitrary stack of port constructs starting with a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be received on a physical port that belongs to
    a link aggregation port group, which in turn is part of a Layer 3 Switched
    Virtual Interface, and at Layer 3 the packet may be received in a tunnel.
    Although the entire port stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of ingress port
    identifiers. First level of ingress port identifier would typically be
    used to monitor the physical port on which
    the packet was received, hence a 16-bit field (half of a 4-Byte metadata)
    is deemed adequate. Second level of ingress port identifier occupies a
    full 4-Byte metadata field, which may be used to monitor a logical port
    on which the packet was received. A 32-bit space at the second level
    allows for an adequately large number of logical ports at each network
    element. The semantics of port identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the port type it reports at each of the two levels.

* Ingress timestamp
  - The device local time when the INT packet was received on the ingress
    physical or logical port.

## Egress Information

* Egress port identifier
  - The port on which the INT packet was sent out. A packet may
    be transmitted on an arbitrary stack of port constructs ending at a
    physical port. For example, a packet may be transmitted on a tunnel,
    out of a Layer 3 Switched Virtual Interface, on a Link Aggregation Group,
    out of a particular physical port belonging to the Link Aggregation Group.
    Although the entire port stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of egress port
    identifiers. First level of egress port identifier would typically be used
    to monitor the physical port on which
    the packet was transmitted, hence a 16-bit field (half of a 4-Byte metadata)
    is deemed adequate. Second level of egress port identifier occupies a full
    4-Byte metadata field, which may be used to monitor a logical port on
    which the packet was transmitted. A 32-bit space at the second level
    allows for an adequately large number of logical ports at each network
    element. The semantics of port identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the port type it reports at each of the two levels.

* Egress timestamp
  - The device local time when the INT packet was processed by the egress
physical or logical port.

* Hop latency
  - Time taken for the INT packet to be switched within the device.

* Egress port TX Link utilization
  - Current utilization of the egress port via which the INT packet was sent
out. Again, devices can use different mechanisms to keep track of the current
rate, such as bin bucketing or moving average. While the latter is clearly
superior to the former, the INT framework does not stipulate the mechanics and
simply leaves those decisions to device vendors.

* Queue occupancy
  - The build-up of traffic in the queue (in bytes, cells, or packets) that the
INT packet observes in the device while being forwarded. The format of this 4-octet 
metadata field is switch implementation specific and the metadata semantics YANG 
model shall describe the format and units of this metadata field in the 
metadata stack.

* Buffer occupancy
  - The build-up of traffic in the buffer (in bytes, cells, or packets) that the
INT packet observes in the device while being forwarded. Use case is when the buffer 
is shared between multiple queues. The format of this 4-octet metadata field is switch 
implementation specific and the metadata semantics YANG model shall describe the format 
and units of this metadata field in the metadata stack.

Details of the metadata semantics YANG model can be accessed at the link below:

https://github.com/p4lang/p4-applications/blob/master/telemetry/code/models/p4-dtel-metadata-semantics.yang

# INT Headers

This section specifies the format and location of INT Headers.
INT Headers and their locations are relevant for
INT-MX, INT-MD, INT-CLONE-MD, and INT-PROBE-MD modes
where the INT instructions (and metadata stack in case of MD modes)
are written into the packets.

## INT Header Types

There are two types of INT Headers, *hop-by-hop* and *destination*.  A given INT
packet may have one or both types of INT Headers. When both INT Header types
are present, the hop-by-hop type must precede the destination type header.

* Hop-by-Hop type (**INT Header type 1**)
  - Intermediate devices (INT Transit Hops) must process this type of INT
    Header. The format of this header is defined in section
    [#sec-int-hop-by-hop-metadata-header-format]
* Destination type (**INT Header type 2**)
  - Destination headers must only be consumed by the INT Sink. Intermediate
    devices must ignore Destination headers.
  - Destination headers can be used to enable communication between the INT
    Source and INT Sink. For example:
      - INT Source can add a sequence number to detect loss of INT packets.
      - INT Source can add the original values of IP TTL and INT Remaining
        Hop Count, thus enabling the INT sink to detect network devices
        on the path that do not support INT by comparing the IP TTL
        decrement against INT Remaining Hop Count decrement (assuming each
        network device is an L3 hop)
  - The data format of Destination type INT Headers is not defined in this
    version.

## Per-Hop Header Creation

In the INT model, each device in the packet forwarding path creates additional
space in the INT Header on-demand to add its own INT metadata. To avoid
exhausting header space in the case of a forwarding loop or any other anomalies,
it is strongly recommended to limit the number of total INT metadata fields
added by devices by setting the Remaining Hop Count field in INT header
appropriately.

## MTU Settings

As each hop creates additional space in the INT header to add its metadata,
the packet size increases. This can potentially cause egress link MTU to be
exceeded at an INT switch.

This may be addressed in the following ways -

* It is recommended that the MTU of links between INT sources and sinks be
configured to a value higher than the MTU of preceding links (server/VM NIC
MTUs) by an appropriate amount. Configuring an MTU differential of
[Per-hop Metadata Length\*4\*INT Hop Count + Fixed INT Header Length] bytes,
based on conservative values of total number of INT hops and Per-hop
Metadata Length, will prevent egress MTU being exceeded due to INT metadata
insertion at INT hops. The Fixed INT Header Length is the sum of INT metadata
header length (8B) and the size of encapsulation-specific shim/option header
(4B) as defined in section [#sec-header-location].

* An INT source/transit switch may optionally participate in dynamic discovery
of Path MTU for flows being monitored by INT by transmitting ICMP message to
the traffic source as per Path MTU Discovery mechanisms of the corresponding
L3 protocol (RFC 1191 for IPv4, RFC 1981 for IPv6). An INT source or transit
switch may report a conservative MTU in the ICMP message, assuming that the
packet will go through the maximum number of allowed INT hops (i.e. Remaining
Hop Count will decrement to zero), accounting for cumulative metadata
insertion at all INT hops, and assuming that the egress MTU at all downstream
INT hops is the same as its own egress link MTU. This will help the path
MTU discovery source to converge to a path MTU estimate
faster, although this would be a conservative path MTU estimate.
Alternatively, each INT hop may report an MTU only accounting for the metadata
it inserts. This would enable the path MTU discovery source converge to a
precise path MTU, at the cost of receiving more ICMP messages, one from each
INT hop.

Regardless of whether or not an INT transit switch participates in Path MTU
discovery, if it cannot insert all requested metadata because doing so will
cause the packet length to exceed egress link MTU, it
must not insert any metadata and set the M bit in the
INT header, indicating that egress MTU was exceeded at an INT hop.

An INT source inserts 12 bytes of fixed INT headers, and may also insert
Per-hop Metadata Length\*4 bytes of its own metadata. If inserting the
fixed headers causes egress link MTU to be exceeded, INT cannot not be
initiated for such packets. If an INT source is programmed to insert
its own INT metadata, and there is enough room in a packet to insert fixed INT
headers, but no additional room for its INT metadata, the source must
initiate INT and set the M bit in the INT header.

In theory, an INT transit switch can perform IPv4 fragmentation to overcome
egress MTU limitation when inserting its metadata. However, IPv4 fragmentation
can have adverse impact on applications. Moreover, IPv6 packets cannot be
fragmented at intermediate hops. Also, fragmenting packets at INT transit hops,
with or without copying preceding INT metadata into fragments imposes
extra complexity of correlating fragments in the INT monitoring engine.
Considering all these factors, this specification requires that an INT
switch must not fragment packets in order to append INT information to
the packet.

## INT over any encapsulation

The specific location for INT Headers is intentionally not specified:
an INT Header can be inserted as an option or payload of any encapsulation
type. The only requirements are that the encapsulation header provides
sufficient space to carry the INT information and that all INT switches
(Sources, transit hops and Sinks) agree on the location of the INT Headers.
The following choices are potential encapsulations using common protocol
stacks, although a deployment may choose a different encapsulation format
if better suited to their needs and environment.

* INT over VXLAN (as VXLAN payload, per GPE extension)
* INT over Geneve (as Geneve option)
* INT over NSH (as NSH payload)
* INT over TCP (as payload)
* INT over UDP (as payload)
* INT over GRE (as a shim between GRE header and encapsulated payload)

## Checksum Update

As described above in section [#sec-int-over-any-encapsulation], INT
headers and metadata may be carried in an L4 protocol such as TCP or UDP,
or in an encapsulation header that includes an L4 header, such as VXLAN.
The checksum field in the TCP or UDP L4 header needs
to be updated as INT switches modify the L4 payload via insertion/removal of
INT headers and metadata. However, there are certain exceptions.
For example, when UDP is transported over IPv4, it is possible to assign a
zero checksum, causing the receiver to ignore the value of the checksum field
(as defined in RFC 768). For UDP over IPv6, there are specific use cases in
which it is possible to assign a zero Checksum (as defined in RFC 6936).

INT source, transit and sink devices must comply with IETF standards
for Layer 4 transport protocols with respect to whether or not Layer 4
checksum is to be updated upon modification of Layer 4 payload.
For example, if an INT source/transit/sink hop receives
UDP traffic with zero L4 checksum, it must not update the L4 checksum
in conformance with the behavior defined in relevant IETF standards
such as RFC 768 and RFC 6936.

When L4 checksum update is required, an INT source/transit switch may update
the checksum in one of two ways:

* Update the L4 Checksum field such that the new value is equal to the checksum
of the new packet, after the INT-related updates (header additions/removals,
field updates), or

* If the INT source indicates that Checksum-neutral updates are allowed by
setting an instruction bit corresponding to the Checksum Complement metadata,
then the INT source/transit switches may assign a value to the Checksum
Complement metadata which guarantees that the existing L4 Checksum is the
correct value of the packet after the INT-related updates.

The motivation for the Checksum Complement is that some hardware implementations
process data packets in a serial order, which may impose a problem when INT
fields and metadata that reside after the L4 Checksum field are inserted or
modified. Therefore, the Checksum Complement metadata, if present, is the last
metadata field in the stack.

Note that when the Checksum Complement metadata is present source/transit
switches may choose to update the L4 Checksum field instead of using the
Checksum Complement metadata. In this case the Checksum Complement metadata
must be assigned the reserved value 0xFFFFFFFF. A host that verifies the
L4 Checksum will be unaffected by whether some or all of the nodes chose
not to use the Checksum Complement, since the value of the L4 Checksum
should fit the Checksum of the payload in either of the cases.

INT sink cannot perform a Checksum-neutral update using Checksum Complement
metadata as it removes all INT headers from the packet. Thus, an INT sink
when performing a checksum update has to do so by updating the L4 Checksum
field.

Regardless of whether checksum update is performed via modifying the L4
checksum field or via use of Checksum Complement metadata, performing the
update based on an incremental checksum calculation (as is typically done)
will ensure that any potential corruption is detected at the point of
checksum validation. If full checksum computation is performed at an INT
switch, it should be preceded by checksum validation so as to not mask out any
corruption at preceding hops.

## Header Location

We describe three encapsulation formats in this specification, covering
different deployment scenarios, with and without network virtualization:

1. *INT over TCP/UDP* - A shim header is inserted following TCP/UDP
header. INT Headers are carried between this shim header and TCP/UDP payload.
This approach doesn’t rely on any tunneling/virtualization mechanism and is
versatile to apply INT to both native and virtualized traffic.
2. *INT over VXLAN* - VXLAN generic protocol extensions
(draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe) are used to carry INT Headers between
the VXLAN header and the encapsulated VXLAN payload.
3. *INT over Geneve* - Geneve is an extensible tunneling framework, allowing
Geneve options to be defined for INT Headers.

### INT over TCP/UDP

In case the traffic being monitored is not encapsulated by any virtualization
header, INT over VXLAN or INT over Geneve is not helpful.
Instead, one can put the INT metadata just after layer 4 headers (TCP/UDP).
The scheme assumes that the non-INT devices between the INT source and the
INT sink either do not parse beyond layer-4 headers or can skip through the
INT stack using the Length field in the INT shim header. If TCP has any options,
the INT stack may come before or after the TCP options but the decision must
be consistent within an INT domain.

Note that INT over UDP can be used even when the packet is encapsulated by VXLAN,
Geneve, or GUE (Generic UDP Encapsulation). INT over TCP/UDP also makes it
easier to add INT stack into outer, inner, or even both layers. In such cases
both INT header stacks carry information for respective layers and need not be
considered interfering with each other.

A field in Ethernet, IP, or TCP/UDP should indicate if the
INT header exists after the TCP/UDP header. We propose three options.

* UDP destination port field: a new UDP port number (INT_TBD) will be assigned
by IANA to indicate the existence of INT after UDP. This option supports two
use cases:
  - The original packet already has UDP header either as user application
    protocol or as part of another UDP-based encapsulation such as VXLAN,
    GENEVE, RoCEv2. INT is inserted after the UDP header with the UDP
    destination port number changed to INT_TBD.
    The original destination port number
    is carried in the shim header for the INT sink to restore back when it
    removes the INT stack from the packet.
  - A new UDP header for INT is inserted between IP and the existing L4 header.
    The protocol field of IP header is set to 17 for UDP and the original
    IP protocol value is carried in the INT shim header.
    In the new UDP header, INT_TBD is used as the destination port number.
    The source port number of the new UDP header must be either 1) copied from the
    original L4 header, 2) computed as a hash of the existing L4 header
    fields (such as source/destination ports in case of TCP/UDP), or 3)
    computed as a hash of the original outer 5 tuple. The second option
    is recommended to provide ECMP/LAG load-balancing logic with the same degree of
    entropy of the original data packet.
The INT shim header has a field NPT (Next Protocol Type) that indicates
which of the two cases are applied to a given INT packet. In case a new UDP
header was inserted, the INT sink will strip the UDP header off from the
packet together with the rest of INT headers.
* IPv4 DSCP or IPv6 Traffic Class field: A value or a bit can be used to
indicate the existence of INT after TCP/UDP. When the INT source inserts the
INT header into a packet, it sets the reserved value in the field or sets the
bit. The INT source may write the original DSCP value in the INT headers so
that the INT sink can restore the original value. Restoring the original value
is optional.
  - Allocating a bit, as opposed to a value codepoint, will allow the rest of
    DSCP field to be used for QoS, hence allowing the coexistence of DSCP-based
    QoS and INT. If the traffic being monitored is subjected to QoS services
    such as rate limiting, shaping, or differentiated queueing based on DSCP
    field, QoS classification in the network must be programmed to
    ignore the designated bit position to ensure that the INT-enabled traffic
    receives the same treatment as the original traffic being monitored.
  - In brownfield scenarios, however, the network operator may not find a bit
    available to allocate for INT but may still have a fragmented space of 32
    unused DSCP values. The operator can allocate an INT-enabled DSCP value
    for every QoS DSCP value, map the INT-enabled DSCP value to the same
    QoS behavior as the corresponding QoS DSCP value. This may double the
    number of QoS rules but will allow the co-existence of DSCP-based QoS and
    INT even when a single DSCP bit is not available for INT.
  - Within an INT domain, DSCP values used for INT must exclusively be used
    for INT. INT transit and switches must not receive non-INT packets
    marked with DSCP values used for INT. Any time a switch forwards a packet
    into the INT domain and there is no INT header present, it must ensure that
    the DSCP/Traffic class value is not the same as any of the values used
    to indicate INT.
* Probe Marker fields: If DSCP field or values cannot be reserved for INT,
probe marker option could be used. A specific 64-bit value can be inserted
after the TCP/UDP header to indicate the existence of INT after TCP/UDP.
These fields must be
interpreted as unsigned integer values in network byte order. This approach is
a variation of an early IETF draft with existing implementation[^DPP].
[^DPP]: Data-plane probe for in-band telemetry collection, https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lapukhov-dataplane-probe-01

INT probe marker for TCP/UDP:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Probe Marker (1)                      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Probe Marker (2)                      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

With arbitrary values being inserted after TCP/UDP header as probe markers,
the likelihood of conflicting with user traffic in a data center is
low, but cannot be completely eliminated. To further reduce the chance of
conflict, a deployment could choose to also examine TCP/UDP port numbers
to validate INT probe marker.

Any of the above options may be used in an INT domain, provided that the INT
transit and sink devices in the INT domain comply with the mechanism chosen
at the INT sources, and are able to correctly identify the presence and location
of INT headers. The above approaches are not intended to interoperate in a
mixed environment, for example it would be incorrect to mark a packet for INT
using both DSCP and probe marker, as INT devices that only understand
DSCP marking and do not recognize probe markers may incorrectly interpret the
first four bytes of the probe marker as INT shim header.
It is strongly recommended that only one option be used within an INT domain.

We introduce an INT shim header for TCP/UDP. The INT
metadata header and INT metadata stack will be encapsulated between
the shim header and the TCP/UDP payload.

INT shim header for TCP/UDP:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type  |NPT|R|R|     Length    |  UDP port, IP Proto, or DSCP  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

* Type (4b): This field indicates the type of INT Header following the shim header.
Two Type values are used: one for the hop-by-hop header type and the other for
the destination header type (See Section [#sec-int-header-types]).
* NPT (Next Protocol Type, 2b): This field is meaningful only when the UDP destination
port number (INT_TBD) is used to indicate the existence of INT. In the other cases,
this field must be zero. When UDP destination port is INT_TBD, this field may have
one of the two values:
** one (1) indicates that UDP payload is followed by the INT stack, and
the last two bytes of the shim header carries the UDP destination port.
** two (2) indicates that another (the original) L4 header is followed by
the INT stack, and the last byte of the shim heaer carries the IP protocol
value for the L4 layer.
* Length (8b): This is the total length of INT metadata header, INT stack and the
shim header in 4-byte words. A non-INT device may read this field
and skip over INT headers.

* UDP port, IP proto, or DSCP: If IP DSCP is used to indicate INT, this field optionally
stores the original DSCP value. For non-zero values of NPT, UDP port number or IP
protocol number is carried accordingly. Otherwise, this field
is reserved.

The other bits in the shim header are reserved (R) for future use.

### INT over VXLAN GPE

VXLAN is a common tunneling protocol for network virtualization and is supported
by most software virtual switches and hardware network elements. The VXLAN
header as defined in RFC 7348 is a fixed 8-byte header as shown below.

VXLAN Header:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |R|R|Ver|I|P|B|O|                     Reserved                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

The amount of free space in the VXLAN header allows for carrying minimal network
state information. Hence, we embed INT metadata in a shim header between the
VXLAN header and the encapsulated payload.

The VXLAN header as defined in RFC 7348 does not specify the protocol being
encapsulated and assumes that the payload following the VXLAN header is an
Ethernet payload. Internet draft draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe proposes
changes to the VXLAN header to allow for multi-protocol encapsulation. We use
this VXLAN generic protocol extension draft and propose a new
“Next-protocol” type for INT.


VXLAN GPE Header:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

P bit: Flag bit 5 is defined as the Next Protocol bit. The P bit MUST be set to
1 to indicate the presence of the 8-bit next protocol field.

Next Protocol Values:

* 0x01: IPv4
* 0x02: IPv6
* 0x03: Ethernet
* 0x04: Network Service Header (NSH)
* 0x05: MPLS
* 0x06: GBP
* 0x07: vBNG
* 0x08: In-band Network Telemetry Header (This value has not been reserved by
VXLAN GPE specification yet, and is hence subject to change)

When there is one INT Header in the VXLAN GPE stack, the VXLAN GPE header for
the INT Header will have a next-protocol value other than INT Header indicating
the payload following the INT Header - typically Ethernet. If there are multiple
INT Headers in the VXLAN GPE stack (for example if both hop-by-hop and
destination type INT headers are being carried), then all VXLAN GPE shim
headers for the INT Headers other than the last one will carry 0x08 for
their next-protocol values, and the VXLAN GPE header for the last INT Header
will carry next-protocol value of the original VXLAN payload (e.g., Ethernet).

To embed a variable-length data (i.e., INT metadata) in the VXLAN GPE stack, we
introduce the INT shim header. This header follows each VXLAN GPE header for
INT.

INT shim header for VXLAN GPE encapsulation:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Variable Option Data (INT Metadata Headers and Metadata)    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

* Type: This field indicates the type of INT Header following the shim header.
Two Type values are used: one for the hop-by-hop header type and the other for
the destination header type (See Section [#sec-int-header-types]).
* Length: This is the total length of the variable INT option data and the shim
header in 4-byte words.

### INT over Geneve

Geneve is a generic and extensible tunneling framework, allowing for INT
metadata to be carried in TLV format as “Option headers” in the tunnel header.

Geneve Header:
`
   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Geneve Option for INT:

   |   Variable Option Data (INT Metadata Headers and Metadata)    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

Note:

* We do not need to reserve any special values for fields in the base
Geneve header for INT.
* Users may or may not use INT with Geneve along with VNI (network
virtualization), though using INT with Geneve without network virtualization
would be a bit wasteful.
* Specific values of Option Class and Type have not been reserved for INT yet.
Deployments using INT over Geneve must use configurable values for Option
Class and Type to be able to migrate to different values as and when specific
values are defined for INT.
* The variable length option data following the Geneve Option Header carries
the actual INT metadata header and metadata.
* The Length field of the Geneve Option header is 5-bits long, which
limits a single Geneve option instance to no more than 124 bytes long (31 * 4).
Remaining Hop Count in hop-by-hop INT header has to be set accordingly at the
INT source to ensure that the Geneve option does not overflow. The entire
hop-by-hop INT header must fit in a single Geneve option.

## INT Hop-by-Hop Metadata Header Format

In this section, we define the format for INT hop-by-hop metadata headers,
and the metadata itself.

INT Metadata Header and Metadata Stack:
`
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Last INT metadata                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
`

* INT metadata header is 8 bytes long followed by a stack of INT metadata.
  Each metadata is either 4 bytes or 8 bytes in length. Each INT hop adds
  the same length of metadata. The total length of the metadata stack is
  variable as different packets may traverse different paths and hence
  different number of INT hops.

* The fields in the INT metadata header are interpreted the following way:
  - Ver (4b): INT metadata header version. Should be 1 for this version.
  - Rep (2b): Replication requested. Support for this request is optional. If
this value is non-zero, the device may replicate the INT packet. This is useful
to explore all the valid physical forwarding paths when multi-path forwarding
techniques (e.g., ECMP, LAG) are used in the network. Note the Rep bits should
be used judiciously (e.g., only for probe packets, not for every data packet).
While we recommend that Rep bits be set only for probe packets, the INT
architecture does not (and perhaps cannot) disallow use of the Rep bits for real
data packets.
    - 0: No replication requested.
    - 1: Port-level (L2-level) replication requested. If the INT packet is
forwarded through a logical port that is a port-channel (LAG), then replicate
the packet on each physical port in the port-channel and send a single copy per
physical port.
    - 2: Next-hop-level (L3-level) replication requested. Forward the packet
to each L3 ECMP next-hop valid for the destination address, with INT headers
replicated in each forwarded copy.
    - 3: Port-level and Next-hop-level replication requested.
  - C (1b): Copy.
    - If replication is requested for data packets, the INT Sink must be
able to distinguish the original packet from replicas so that it can forward
only original packets up the protocol stack, and drop all the replicas. The C
bit must be set to 1 on each copy, whenever an INT hop replicates a packet.
The original packet must have C bit set to 0.
    - C bit must be set to 0 in the original packet by INT source
  - E (1b): Max Hop Count exceeded.
    - This flag must be set if a device cannot prepend its own metadata due to
      the Remaining Hop Count reaching zero.
    - E bit must be set to 0 by INT source
  - M (1b): MTU exceeded
    - This flag must be set if a device cannot add all of the requested metadata
      because doing so will cause the packet length to exceed egress link MTU.
      In this case, the device must not add any metadata to the packet, and set
      the M bit in the INT header. Note that it is possible for egress MTU
      limitation to prevent INT metadata insertion at multiple hops along a
      path. The M bit simply serves as an indication that INT metadata was not
      inserted at one or more hops and corrective action such as reconfiguring
      MTU at some links may be needed, particularly when INT switches are not
      participating in path MTU discovery. The M bit is not aimed at readily
      identifying which switch(es) did not insert INT metadata due to egress MTU
      limitation. In theory, if this does not occur at consecutive hops,
      it may be possible for the monitoring system to derive which
      switch(es) set the M bit based on knowledge of the network topology
      and "Switch ID, Ingress port ID, Egress port ID" tuples in the INT
      metadata stack.
  - R (10b): Reserved bits.
  - Hop ML (5b): Per-hop Metadata Length, the length of metadata in 4-Byte words
    to be inserted at each INT hop.
    - While the largest value of Per-hop Metadata Length is 31, an INT-capable
      device may be limited in the maximum number of instructions it can process
      and/or maximum length of metadata it can insert in data packets. An INT
      hop that cannot process all instructions must still insert Per-hop
      Metadata Length \* 4 bytes, with all-ones reserved value (4 or 8 bytes
      of 0xFF depending on the length of metadata) for the metadata
      corresponding to instructions it cannot process. An INT hop that
      cannot insert Per-hop Metadata Length \* 4 bytes must skip INT
      processing altogether and not insert any metadata in the packet.
  - Remaining Hop Count (8b): The remaining number of hops that are allowed to
    add their metadata to the packet.
    - Upon creation of an INT metadata header, the INT Source must set this
      value to the maximum number of hops that are allowed to add metadata
      instance(s) to the packet. Each INT-capable device on the path, including
      the INT Source as well as INT Transit Hops, must decrement the
      Remaining Hop Count if and when it pushes its local metadata onto the
      stack.
    - When a packet is received with the Remaining Hop Count equal to 0, the
      device must ignore the INT instruction, pushing no new metadata onto
      the stack, and the device must set the E bit.
* INT instructions are encoded as a bitmap in the 16-bit INT Instruction field:
each bit corresponds to a specific standard metadata as specified in Section 3.
  - bit0 (MSB): Switch ID
  - bit1: Level 1 Ingress Port ID (16 bits) + Egress Port ID (16 bits)
  - bit2: Hop latency
  - bit3: Queue ID (8 bits) + Queue occupancy (24 bits)
  - bit4: Ingress timestamp
  - bit5: Egress timestamp
  - bit6: Level 2 Ingress Port ID + Egress Port ID (4 bytes each)
  - bit7: Egress port Tx utilization
  - bit8: Buffer ID (8 bits) + Buffer occupancy (24 bits)
  - bit15: Checksum Complement
  - The remaining bits are reserved.
  
  Semantics of Queue occupancy and Buffer occupancy is the default semantics of
  those two metadata. Additional semantics as needed for different implementation
  can be defined in the metadata semantics YANG model. 
  
  Details of the metadata semantics YANG model can be accessed at the link below:
  https://github.com/p4lang/p4-applications/blob/master/telemetry/code/models/p4-dtel-metadata-semantics.yang
  
  Each instruction requests 4 bytes of metadata to be inserted at each hop,
  except if bit 6 is set, which requires 8 bytes of metadata. Per-hop
  metadata length is set accordingly at the INT source.
  
  
* Each INT Transit device along the path that supports INT adds its own metadata
values as specified in the instruction bitmap immediately after the INT metadata
header.
  - When adding a new metadata, each device must prepend its metadata in
    front of the metadata that are already added by the upstream devices.
    This is similar to the push operation on a stack. Hence, the most recently
    added metadata appears at the top of the stack. The device must add
    metadata in the order of bits set in the instruction bitmap.
  - If a device is unable to provide a metadata value specified in the
    instruction bitmap because its value is not available, it must add a special
    all-ones reserved value indicating "invalid" (4 or 8 bytes of 0xFF
    depending on metadata length).
  - If a device cannot add all the metadata required by the instruction bitmap
    (irrespective of the availability of the metadata values that are asked
    for), it must skip processing that particular INT packet entirely. This
    ensures that each INT Transit device adds either zero bytes or
    Per-hop Metadata Length\*4 bytes to the packet.
  - Reserved bits in the instruction bitmap are to be handled similarly. If an
    INT transit hop receives a reserved bit set in the instruction bitmap (e.g.
    set by a INT source that is running a newer version), the transit hop must
    either add corresponding metadata filled with the reserved value 0xFFFFFFFF
    or must not add any INT metadata to the packet. This means that an
    instruction bit marked reserved in this specification may be
    used for a 4B metadata in a subsequent minor version while still being
    backward compatible with this specification. However, an instruction bit
    marked reserved in this specification may be used for a 8B metadata only
    in the next major version, breaking backward compatibility and requring all
    INT switches to be upgraded to the new major version. For example
    a version 1.0 INT switch cannot operate alongside version 2.0 INT switches
    if a new 8B metadata is introduced in version 2.0, as the version 1.0
    INT switch could insert 0xFFFFFFFF reserved value for a 8B metadata field,
    thus breaking the metadata stack length invariance - the length of
    metadata stack will not be a multiple of Per-Hop Metadata length \* 4
    in this case.
  - If an INT transit hop does not add metadata to a packet due to any of the
    above reasons, it must not decrement the remaining INT hop count in the INT
    metadata header.
* Summary of the field usage
  - The INT Source must set the following fields:
    - Ver, Rep, C, M, Per-hop Metadata Length, Remaining Hop Count,
      and Instruction Bitmap.
    - INT Source must set all reserved bits to zero.
  - Intermediate devices can set the following fields:
    - C, E, M, Remaining Hop Count
* The length (in bytes) of the INT metadata stack must always
be a multiple of (Per-hop Metadata Length \* 4). This length can be determined
by subtracting the total INT fixed header sizes (12 bytes)
from (shim header length \* 4).
For INT over Geneve it is 8 bytes subtracted from (length in Geneve tunnel
option header \* 4).

# Examples

This section shows example INT Headers with two hosts (Host1 and Host2),
communicating over a network path composed of three network devices
(Switch1, Switch2 and Switch3) as shown below.

`
                 ==> packet P travels from Host1 to Host2 ==>
Host1 --------> Switch1 ---------> Switch2 ---------> Switch3 --------> Host2
`

Detailed assumptions made for this example are as follows

* INT source requests each INT hop to insert switch ID and queue occupancy
(For the sake of illustration we only consider switch ID and queue occupancy
being inserted at each hop. Queue IDs are typically defined per port, hence
in a real use-case queue occupancy is likely to be collected along with egress
port ID)
* There are three devices (hops) on the path, and all the devices expose
  both metadata (switch ID and queue occupancy).
* The maximum number of hops (network diameter) is 8.
* The values of INT metadata header fields in this example are as follows:
  - Ver = 1
  - Rep = 0 (No replication)
  - C = 0
  - E = 0 (Max Hop Count not exceeded)
  - M = 0 (MTU not exceeded at any switch)
  - Per-hop Metadata Length = 2 (for switch id & queue occupancy)
  - Remaining hop count starts at 8, decremented by 1 at each hop
    that inserts INT metadata

## Example with INT over TCP

We consider a scenario where host1 sends a TCP packet to host2. The ToR switch
of host1 (Switch1) acts as the INT source. It adds INT headers and its own
metadata in the packet. Switch2 prepends its metadata. Finally, the ToR
switch of host2 (Switch3) acts as the INT sink and removes INT headers before
forwarding the packet to host2.

Below is the packet received by INT sink Switch3, starting from the IPv4
header. We use the value of 0x17 for IPv4.DSCP to indicate the existence of
INT headers.

## Example with INT over VXLAN GPE

We now consider a scenario where Host1 and Host2 use VXLAN encapsulation.
Host1 acts as VXLAN tunnel endpoint and INT source, inserts VXLAN and INT
headers with instruction bits corresponding to the network state to be
reported at intermediate switches. In this example, Host1 itself does
not insert any INT metadata. Intermediate switches parse through VXLAN
header and populate the INT metadata. Host2 acts as INT sink and VXLAN
tunnel endpoint, removes INT and VXLAN headers.

The packet headers received at Host 2 are as follows, starting with the VXLAN
header (encapsulating ethernet, IP and UDP headers are not shown here):

VXLAN GPE Header:

## Example with INT over Geneve

Finally, we consider a scenario where Host1 and Host2 use Geneve encapsulation.
Host1 acts as Geneve tunnel endpoint and INT source, inserts Geneve and INT
headers with instruction bits corresponding to the network state to be
reported at intermediate switches. In this example, Host1 itself does
not insert any INT metadata. Intermediate switches parse through Geneve
header and populate the INT metadata. Host2 acts as INT sink and Geneve
tunnel endpoint, removes INT and Geneve headers.

The following is the Geneve and INT Headers attached to the packet received by
Host2.

# Appendix: An extensive (but not exhaustive) set of Metadata {@h1:"A"}

Here we list a set of examplary metadata that future versions of the spec may
support as well as those are supported in the current spec.

## Switch-level

* Switch id
  - The unique ID of a switch (generally administratively assigned). SwitchIDs
must be unique within a domain.
* Control plane state version number
  - Whenever a control-plane state changes (e.g., IP FIB update), the switch
control plane can also update this version number in the data plane. INT
packets
may use these version numbers to determine which control-plane state was active
at the time packets were forwarded.

## Ingress

* Ingress port identifier
  - The port on which the INT packet was received. A packet may be received
    on an arbitrary stack of port constructs starting with a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be received on a physical port that belongs to a
    link aggregation port group, which in turn is part of a Layer 3 Switched
    Virtual Interface, and at Layer 3 the packet may be received in a tunnel.
    Although the entire port stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of ingress port
    identifiers. The semantics of port identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the port type it reports at each of the two levels.
* Ingress timestamp
  - The device local time when the INT packet was received on the **_ingress_**
physical or logical port.
* Ingress port RX pkt count
  - Total # of packets received so far (since device initialization or counter
reset) on the ingress physical or logical port where the INT packet was
received.
* Ingress port RX byte count
  - Total # of bytes received so far on the ingress physical or logical port
where the INT packet was received.
* Ingress port RX drop count
  - Total # of packet drops occurred so far on the ingress physical or logical
port where the INT packet was received.
* Ingress port RX utilization
  - Current utilization of the ingress physical or logical port where the INT
packet was received. The exact mechanism (bin bucketing, moving average, etc.)
is device specific and while the latter is clearly superior to the former, the
INT framework leaves those decisions to device vendors.

## Egress

* Egress port identifier
  - The port on which the INT packet was sent out. A packet may be transmitted
    on an arbitrary stack of port constructs ending at a physical port.
    For example, a packet may be transmitted on a tunnel, out of a Layer 3
    Switched Virtual Interface, on a Link Aggregation Group, out of a
    particular physical port belonging to the Link Aggregation Group.
    Although the entire port stack may be monitored in theory, this
    specification allows for monitoring of up to two levels of egress port
    identifiers. The semantics of port identifiers may differ across devices,
    each INT hop chooses the port type it reports at each of the two levels.
* Egress timestamp
  - The device local time when the INT packet was processed by the egress
physical or logical port.
* Egress port TX pkt count
  - Total # of packets forwarded so far (since device initialization or counter
reset) through the egress physical or logical port where the INT packet was also
forwarded.
* Egress port TX byte count
  - Total # of bytes forwarded so far through the egress physical or logical
port where the INT packet was forwarded.
* Egress port TX drop count
  - Total # of packet drops occurred so far on the egress physical or logical
port where the INT packet was forwarded.
* Egress port TX utilization
  - Current utilization of the egress port via which the INT packet was sent
out.

## Buffer Information

* Queue id
  - The id of the queue the device used to serve the INT packet.
* Instantaneous queue length
  - The instantaneous length (in bytes, cells, or packets) of the queue the INT
packet has observed in the device while being forwarded.  The units used need
not be consistent across an INT domain, but care must be taken to ensure that
there is a known, consistent mapping of {device, queue} values to their
respective unit {packets, bytes, cells}.
* Average queue length
  - The average length (in bytes, cells, or packets) of the queue via which the
INT packet was served.  The calculation mechanism of this value is device
specific.
* Queue drop count
  - Total # of packets dropped from the queue


The metadata below are introduced to capture the buffer occupancy INT packet 
observes in the device while being forwarded. Use case is when buffer is
shared between multiple queue.

* Buffer id
  - The id of the buffer the device used to serve the INT packet.
* Instantaneous buffer occupancy
  - The instantaneous value (in bytes, or cells) of the buffer occupancy the INT
packet has observed in the device while being forwarded.  The units used need
not be consistent across an INT domain, but care must be taken to ensure that
there is a known, consistent mapping of {device, buffer} values to their
respective unit {bytes, cells}.
* Average buffer occupancy
  - The average value (in bytes or cells) of the buffer occupancy that
the INT packet was observed. The calculation mechanism of this value is device
specific.

## Miscellaneous

* Checksum Complement
  - This field enables a Checksum-neutral update when INT is encapsulated over
an L4 protocol that uses a Checksum field, such as TCP or UDP.
